## Module 1: What's Beyond Uber?
- spot innovation from platforms
- lots of online platforms for various purposes
- what is the meaning of the word `platform`?

### Course Outcomes
- understand the impact of platforms in out daily life?
- identify the main types (or classifications) of platforms in the business world
- assess the evolution of the concept of platform over time
- apply the main "platform thinking" logic to existing platforms to measure innocative power

### Intro to Platforms
- address or support daily activities, such as:
	- running, cycling (strava)
	- watching TV (netflix)
	- food and goods deliveries (deliveroo, grab)
	- ride-hailing
	- home rentals for unique experiences

- in the past daily activities such as the above are done the **traditional way** and without the use of an Internet connection.
	- now, these activities are mediated by digital platforms
	- digital platforms are pervasive and made our life easier
		- change the rules of the game $\implies$ new ways of producing, delivering and enjoying goods and services

- understand how platform companies disrupt entire sectors in a short span of a few years $\implies$ learn about innovation, regardless of the sector

## Module 2: Living the platform revolution

### Innovation
- Innovation is symbolically recognized as the light bulb
- Example: Thomas Edison made contributions in
	- electric power
	- mass communication
	- sound recording
	- motion pictures
	- founded 14 companies $\implies$ combined to General Electric of the NYSE

General Electric used its financial strength to enter new businesses
- growth by expanding into other businesses using assets (i.e. capital, engineering capabilities, knowledge of international markets)

#### Growth of Companies in 2000s
**Example: Amazon**
- old business model: large book warehouse to sell books, bridge between authors and their readers (the end user), allows anyone to order any kind of book from the Internet
- allows one to have all books at once
- developed product line to also include DVDs and CDs besides Books
- Amazon decided to instead sell its logistical expertise (as a service) to quickly deliver goods within the USA

- Amazon continues to develop new services and identifying assets
	- Cloud Computing
	- Amazon Mechanical Turk
	- Purchase Recommendations

- Startup to Global MNC in 20 years.
	- one of the FAANG companies, which have open the door to the platform revolution
	- new way of creating value through the proliferation of small companies to become large corporations to challenge traditional market incumbents

Example: Starwood Hotels and Resorts
- established to take advantage of a tax break
- owned a number of hotels across N America
- 2016: acquired by Marriot

Example: Airbnb
- anyone with a space can rent it out, anyone wanting a accommodation can rent one
- 4 million listings, only 3k employees

We study companies of different sizes, logics. We are in need of new business models, theories and tools to understand platforms.
- replicating a business model is simple
- understanding the model is harder
- potential of platforms $\implies$ reliant on those who understand how to create and make it evolve over time.
- platforms which leverage multi-sided segments which are interdependent on each other
	- first being laser-focused on a certain customer segment or demographic then expanding it
	- addressing $\geq 2$ fundamentally different customers (user value-add and advertisers who pay these platforms to host their ads) $\implies$ provide value to all side of the market
	- i.e. social media

- platforms also focus on ease of use of their products and services through the consideration of various factors such as: simplicity, usability and customer immediacy (satisfying the wants in a short period of time)
	- not including multi-page T&C documents for insurance apps to improve user friendliness

### Fostering Innovation in Platforms
- growing interest in digital platforms global started in the 2010s
	- AirBnBs for cars, babysitting etc.
	- Uber for ride-hailing

- platforms companies are still being talked about a decade after their inception

Key Question to ask: What makes a successful digital platform?
- platform based on intuition of matching service consumers and service providers $\implies$ resolve the market friction or the difficulty for one party to find the other (i.e. the $1^{st}$ step)
- complex system to provide value to both parties in the multi-sided segment
	- Customer: real-time info on driver's whereabouts, pay on the app itself via credit card instead of using cash payment and having payment mismatched
	- Driver: provide them with view of potential clients nearby

- manage to bring both types of customers on board
- identifying other problems and creating new solutions to them (i.e. Uber eats created for the problem of idle drivers)
- exploiting critical mass it created in the first instance, integrating a new type of transaction to the platform for enhance convenience
- collection of data points, providing data as a product to data brokers and 3rd parties like researchers

**Process of creating Successful Platform**
Becoming a true idle asset hunting (transferring value)
1. Identification of idle assets (i.e. time and cars), fighting market friction
2. Design a double value proposition
	- value must be clear to all involved parties
3. Bring on board customers (onboarding)
4. Are there other idle assets worth exploiting and for whom they can be a value driver? (go back to step 1)

**The Platform Concept:** facilitating the meeting of those who are looking for something, and those who are offering that something.
- Oldest concept: Marketplace (i.e. meeting of businesses and their consumers), such as Middle Eastern Bazaars
	- Increase in market regulations $\implies$ provided consumers w confidence on pricing fairness and quality of products
	- bring to the same digital location, people looking for and offering smthg,  give all parties interest an opportunity to find something
	- increased potential of turning potential customers into paying customers and increase the reach of products and services through the reach of the platform

- can find older platforms like Booking.com, eBay, PayPal etc. (precursors to the platform revolution)

Together the spread of digital technologies and the platform revolution globally results in a co-joint action paving the way for an era of innovation.

Platforms undermine the traditional business model that customers pay for what they receive.
- Platform revolution can help to foster innovation even in existing established businesses and brands (Disney creating Disney+ Streaming platform by using their catalogue of movies)

#### Measuring Value
Even though Digital Platforms might be considered small in the early stages (in terms of market penetration and values) $\implies$ could still have high valuation (in the billions)
- To calculate valuation of such a young digital platform, we also need to include the consideration of potential market and value effects in the underlying system (i.e. in relation with its industry)
- platforms are very far away from traditional value creation principles $\implies$ the need to consider different metrics to measure the value of the company instead.
	- endanger tools used to measure value of traditional businesses

- Can use Porter's value chain to measure the transfer of value from supplier to the company itself
- Or use Christensen's disruptive innovation model to show the need for niche products

> Each Company in a platform is an orchestrator of value
- **platform model** per se is *not an innovation*
- but provides new innovations in the industry (enabler of the innovation)
	- possibility of doing something new

## Module 3: The history of platforms
1. We can use platforms as a model that inspires innovation
2. The concept of the word `platform` is complex and inconsistent, across those who define them.

- misconception that platforms are for the younger people has some tech literacy barrier to entry $\implies$ diverse group of users
	- platforms are very human-related as the audience that they serve.

- platforms are more horizontal rather than hierarchical in nature
### Product Platforms
**Example: The Sony Walkman**
- the first definition of product platform or internal platform
> A platform is a set of components that create a basic structure common across many of the company's products.
- product platforms can be quite local in nature, have to be scaled one city or locality at a time.

- device to listen to music on the day
	- average obsolescence of the product was 2 years, $\gt 1.2$ year average of other competitors $\implies$ longer life cycle on the market

- this product was extremely targeted at a market niche
	- **iterations of product development** over 10 years to introduce smaller form factors and product enhancements to appeal to audience over 5 iterations
	- relied on only certain types of architectures and had specific components $\implies$ focusing on investing in basic structures as a foundation of subsequent walkman models
	- products are derived from the "base" platform, with plugins or add-ons added to differentiate product lines

- status of a market leader in terms of market share and value captured

##### Elements for identifying the features in platforms
- Product platform allows for the shortening of the development time needed of a new product by creating the basic architecture / blueprint for developing product derivatives
- Product platform offers advantages financially, allowing to spread platform investment across multiple products, on *higher volumes*
- The platform in this case is not the actual tangible product $\implies$ cannot be monetized
	- Rather, it is a tool to streamline new product development

- entails a higher risk (bad base / blueprint $=$ bad family of products)
### Innovation Platforms
- definition of a platform has been changing over the past few years 
	- leaving boundary of a singular organization (internal platforms)
	- giving rise to the terms innovation platform or industry-wide platforms

**Example: the Personal Computer**
- started as a joint project by Microsoft, Intel and IBM.
	- combine hardware and software components to create the computer
	- Microsoft $\to$ Windows OS and word processing suite
	- made the PC platform to external software developers, to enable development of new applications to exploit the potential of the PC platform
		- opens up new value generation dynamics $\implies$ use the basic structure created by the three companies to write software

- Ability to develop new products on a set of pre-existing components without having to reinvent the wheel
	- OS/software platforms are an intermediary between end-users and developers (who are complementors)

Value is captured by:
1. retaining some % of transactions made by end-users and complementors, who sell the product $\implies$ allowing others to innovate on the platform
2. charging complementors for access to the platform (subscription-based fees) $\implies$ directly selling the platform as a service

> **Innovation Platforms** are products, services and technologies that act as a foundation on which external innovators / complementors can develop their own complementary products, services or technologies.
- also known as industry-wide platforms, as they are industry specific
- is a solution that pulls two sided markets together

**Example 2: iOS**
- allows developers to create something new
#### Differences between Product and Innovation Platforms

| Similarities to Product                                                    | Differences from Product                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable Innovation by simplifying product development processes             | Platform itself can be a product (for complementors)                                                                                        |
| Start from common structure to establish diversified products and services | Network Externalities* can impact the value of the platform (cannot really control the risks associated with a product / internal platform) |
|                                                                            | Platforms can be monetized and value may be captured through innovations of complementors                                                   |

*Network externalities are when consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by their peer's purchasing decisions as well

### Transactional two-sided platforms
Has two distinct sides, i.e. in a credit card example
1. Card-holders (1st side)
2. VISA / Master (the platform)
3. Merchants (2nd side) $\implies$ complementor pays the platform for the platform as a product

**Background**
- Without a platform, we have a customer-supplier dynamic
- In context of a platform, *both* Card-holders and Merchants *are customers*, that are **directly linked together**
- Card has no value, unless there are merchants who are willing to accept the card that the cardholder holds
- platforms enhance the reach of consumers and complementors who otherwise will not have such an opportunity to perform transactions as easily.
	- requires a lot of players on both side of the game and supply that the complementors provide (issue of meeting supply for goods and services with demand)

Mechanism of interdependence is called indirect network externalities
- value of platforms dependent on the actors on both sides of the platform (there is no linear value chain, unless a more traditional business)'
- platforms *need to convince* said two groups of their business idea & for both to want to participate in it $\implies$ has no intrinsic value yet (chicken and egg paradox)
	- platforms can choose to subsidize the side that is harder to convince $\implies$ how to define the pricing strategy of the platform
	- cross-price elasticity of demand between the two sides as a metric for identifying which side to subsidize
	- platform needs to sort of fake the impression to onboard complementors

> **Two-sided Markets** is when we have two distinct customers bases leveraging cross-side externalities
- allows the players involved to get in touch, know one another and work together
- can further evolve to become Transactional Two-sided Platform $\implies$ create value by connecting different groups or customers
	- increase product's value of a result of complementary or competing products
- need to understand customer's needs on both sides to derive a good idea of what the market is looking out for.

- derive value creation from this centralization of commerce (but without intrinsic value, as no tangible products are created)
	- rather the facilitating of transactions between sides.

- like innovation platforms, transactional platforms require $\geq 2$ groups, but it cannot function without at least 2 sides.

**Example: Apple App Store**

### Regulation of platforms
- role is to listen to stakeholders and try to find a way to protect the interests of all of them if at all possible.

> Sharing economy is a concept based on platforms, in which we are sharing goods with other people.
-  have to strike a balance between being liberal and protectionist with platform policies

- Scaling of platforms should take place from one locality to another since the regulations greatly vary.

### Orthogonal (Non-Transactional)  Two-Sided Platforms
 > Platform Thinking: being able to use platform mechanisms, even if we don't see them by default.
- Agencies were platforms for newspapers and advertisers.
- enables businesses to broaden their business model by increasing the value captured by the platform
#### Client as the target
**Platform: Newspaper Publishers**
- readers of newspapers (Youtube videos) being subsidized by advertisers
- advertisers buy the reader's attention
- a platform does not allow a transaction btwn the two sides.

- readers <-> platform, platform orthogonal to advertisers
	- in this case, the readers only receive a service controlled by the central platform.
	- advertisers make the business model economically sustainable through the financial value that it generates

> **Orthogonal Platforms** are products and services based on the sale of **different services** to two groups of customers who don't come in direct contact (no digital marketplace), instead relying on a unidirectional cross-side network externality.
- value of the platform increase for users on one side because there are more users on the other side, but converse not true.
- value generated by advertisers increases as readership increase, but not the reverse.
#### Client as the source
- social networks, i.e. Twitter (free for the end user until Elon Musk)
	- creating new service to purchase tweets for a specific topic (i.e. US elections)

Orthogonal side leverages the mass of users created by the platform as a source of service (i.e. the data collected from twitter users are used by advertisers paying twitter)


1. Fusion of Client-as-a-target and Client-as-a-Source models
	- create enhanced advertising
	
2. E-ethnography
	- using collected data to do market research on customer perceptions (social domains of interaction through internet technologies used)

3. Data Trading
	- done with aggregate data and not individual data entries.

## Module 4: Hybrid Platforms and the future of platforms
- are inherently not the same, vary from one to another

- if there is only one group of users, the business is **NOT** a platform (i.e. needs to have complementors to be termed as such).

- as # users $\uparrow$ , value generated $\uparrow$
