If we come across any financial report, it will usually contain:
- Balance Sheet
- Income Statement
- Cash Flow Statement
## A. The Balance Sheet
- shows the value of the firm's assets and liabilities at a particular time
- "take a photograph" of everything in the Holland Village Restaurant (at the current point in time)
- assets are arranged **top-down in decreasing order of liquidity** (how *readily* you can convert something to cash)
	- cash is the most liquid (cash is at the top)
	- things like land and property is not very liquid (needs a long process to be converted to cash)
		- liquidity depends on the surrounding context itself as well

- ⚠️ there are guidelines of how assets should be reported (in preparation for audit). Any **assets** listed in the balance sheet **must fulfil** the following criteria:
	1. Has to come out of a *previous transaction*, AND
	2. Has a future value (if the asset is not being used, usually as part of the PPE classification in fixed assets, then we **remove it** from the balance sheet)
		- i.e. Brand Name of the company should not be in the balance sheet because although it might have future value, it does not come out of a previous transaction

	3. An exception is goodwill (can be recorded as an asset as well)

- can be expressed as a common size balance sheet $\implies$ transform everything into a percentage
#### Terminology
- `LESS`: deduct the amount
- `issue`: a bond / loan: means that the company's liability increases
### Components of the Balance Sheet
#### B1. Assets
LHS contains assets (i.e. the investments) $\implies$ broken down into current and fixed assets
- an asset is an investment or something that provides cash in the future
##### Current Assets
- Examples: Raw materials, ingredients, utensils, fans, tables and chairs, equipment, supplies, land
- Useful economic life $\neq$ actual lifespan
###### 1. Cash & Securities
- Securities, which are financial assets that can be traded in the market
	- security is easily converted into cash (i.e. through the process of selling the stock)
###### 2. Receivables
Receivables are also called *Account Receivables* (it is an asset)
- it is an asset
- why we want to wait for some time
	- Good in a B2C setting because most payments are done in terms of credit (IOUs) where there is a payment period (usually after 60, 90 or 120 days)

- receivable are the second most liquid after cash because the sale has already occurred $\implies$ can expect future provision of cash
	- getting cash for the customers
###### 3. Inventory
Can be sub-categorized into:
- ***Raw Material***: meat and vegetables that *require processing* before being sold (are usually in a state that are not yet ready to be sold)
- ***Work-In-Progress***: still in the *processing stage*
	- meat that has started cooking, or BMW that is still in the warehouse
- ***Finished Goods***: goods that are *ready to be served* to the customer

###### 4. Other current assets
Assets that we fail to classify into the previous few categories **for current assets** only (does not include those fixed assets)
-  Prepayments
	- rent being *paid in advance* for the next fiscal year $\implies$ like an asset to the company since we can use the money elsewhere (can generate cash from it)
	- is an asset even though we obtain future economic benefit
- Short-term investments ($\leq$ 1 year)
	- payment of employees trip's $\implies$ employees creating value for the corporation
###### 5. Non-Current / Fixed Assets
Not involved in day-to-day operations, but is what is being used to ***create value***, are **physical assets**.
Can be subcategorized into Tangible and Intangible assets
- Tangible
	- Notable Category: Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) is the original purchase price of **all the assets** that the corporation owns
		- PPE listed in fixed assets column is the **original purchase price** of the item(s) in question, **not adjusted for inflation etc.** $\implies$ this is called the ==book value== of the item
		- less accumulated depreciation $\implies$ value of the asset after $x$ numbers of years usually decreases ("lost value"), **is a cumulative number** $\sum$ from the start of the company's existence
			- guidelines followed are for the useful life of assets, so depreciation is just a percentage of the overall value of the asset in question
			- after the (useful) lifespan of the PPE item is up, then it will be **removed from the balance sheet**

	- $\text{Net Tangible fixed assets} = \text{PPE} - \text{accumulated depreciation}$

		- the course focuses on **only straight line depreciation** (i.e. a fix decrement in value across time) to avoid complications
		- when the value of the asset hit zero, then there is no need to include it into the balance sheet
		
	- hard to convert tangible asset like a house into cash

	- Other notable category: Land and Building

- Intangible - Michelin star, R&D, patented way of doing something etc.
	- *Goodwill* (as an intangible asset) $\implies$ is **recorded in the purchasing company's balance sheet**, in the case of acquisitions and mergers (exception as a brand name)
	- when acquiring a company, all the assets, liabilities and shareholder equity of the company being acquired is being recorded in the acquiring company's balance sheet
	- cannot detail or quantify things like R&D patents in the balance sheet since there is no previous transaction value
	- when we capitalise an intangible assets that we purchase of someone else ($\leq$ cost value when we purchase it)
### The RHS
RHS is how we are financing whatever we have bought (the liabilities and equity)
- main components being liability (what we owe a bank or any debt-holder) and shareholder's equity (what is left in the company)
	- we can pay off the liabilities
#### B2. Liability
*Are arranged from earliest to latest due*

**Comprises of:**
- Current liabilities / accounts payable are **due within a short term**, usually within **one year**
	- Payables or *Accounts Payable*
		- is the opposite of accounts receivable (one persons account payable is someone else's accounts receivable)
		- usually what we *owe suppliers*
		- in exchange, we obtain something tangible in return (i.e. some raw ingredients, or a university education for one semester, unearned revenue)
		- we agree to pay a price at a later time
		
	- Short-term debt (i.e. bank loan that has to be paid $\leq 1$ year)

	- Other current liabilities
		- liabilities that are small (lower worth relatively in value), so we cannot create the individual category
		- could be hundreds of current liabilities (owe something to a lot of people, but for a small fee value) $\implies$ *salaries payable*
		- i.e. university has yet to deliver an education paid for in advance by students
		- taxes payable
		- accruals (have quote, but don't have invoice) $\implies$ subject to change
	
- Long-term liability 
	- can be long-term *repeated bank loans or housing payment*
	- can also be *bonds* that the company has issued (promises of IOU)
		- less flexible
	- mortgages and employee pensions (i.e. CPF)

In summary:
$$
\text{Total Liabilities} = \text{Current Liabilities} + \text{Long term debt} +  \text{Other long term liabilities}
$$
#### B3. Shareholder equity
Is of the idea: What is left of the company?
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Equity} &= \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} \\
&= \text{Net Assets}
\end{aligned}
$$
Is made up of the following three components:
- **Common stock** and other paid-in capital
	- example being IPO (initial share price that is released for the first time)
	- common stock is held by corporation shareholders

 - **Retained Earnings**
	- idea that funds can be *given back* to the investor or *reinvested*
	- net income that goes back to the company (net income goes into retained earnings), and is *cumulative*.
	- the amount we reinvest into the company after paying for dividends $\implies$ any dividends issued to shareholders are subtracted from here
	- also known as accumulated profits held for future use (from the beginning of its existence)
	- can compare paid-in-capital to equity to determine how many $\times$ company has made as compared to the shareholder's initial investment
	- is *somewhat like profit*
  
- **Treasury stock**
	- all the stocks that the company buys back from its shareholders

*Capital Contributions* is the funds that the owner supplies into the business

| Entity Type                                 | Sole Proprietor   | Partnership           | Corporation                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| *Capital Contributions*                   | Owner's Equity    | Partner Contributions | Shareholder's Equity                            |
| *Accumulated Profits Held for Future Use* | Retained Earnings | Retained Earnings     | Retained Earnings                               |
| *Withdrawals*                             | Drawings          | Partner Drawings      | Dividends (profits distributed to shareholders) |

### A = L + E

**Notes on the above table**
- $\text{Total Current Assets} = \text{Cash \& Securities} + \text{Accounts Receivable} + \text{Inventories}$
- Debt Due for repayment can be swapped with Accounts payable (order does not matter that much)
- $\text{Total Current Liabilities} = \text{Debt due for repayment} + \text{Accounts Payable}$
- Accountant uses double entry booking which is out of scope of IS2218
- Left hand side is the Investing part (Assets) and the right hand side is the Financing part (Liabilities and Equity)

- *Common Size* balance sheet is expressed as a percentage of total assets instead of numerical figures (floating point numbers or integral numbers)
	- everything is shown as a percentage of the total assets ==(Assets equate to $100\%$)==
	- can conclude interesting things, like liabilities is $x\%$ of total assets.

### Other definitions and Formulas
> *def* **Leverage company** have liabilities figures that are higher than equity

> Accounting Equation: $A = L + E$

Either $L \downarrow \: E \downarrow$  or $L \uparrow \: E \downarrow$

## B. Book Value and Market Values
**Book Value:** the value of assets or liabilities according to balance sheet
- based on the *historical costs* and adjusted for depreciation $\implies$ are backward looking
- is still relevant (getting loads of information from this balance sheet)
- is a "claim" of how much the product is worth
- usually we look at this in a balance sheet $\implies$ 

**Market Value:** the value of *asset or liability* if they were resold in a market
- is *forward-looking*, based on the future value of assets or liability
- possible to create a market-value balance sheet
- Market Value of Equity = share price $\times$ no. of shares (i.e. market cap)

Generally Accepted Accounting Practices $\implies$ use book value / historical costs

***Note:*** The book values for `Asset` and `Equity` are generally higher than their book values
- because the company needs to make money, so in a sense it has to create value from the assets and equity collected

Is Shareholders Equity = Share Price?
- market value of equity is share

Liability depends on the **prevailing interest rates** (usually book value $\lt$ market value)
- short-term liability will be closer to the book value
- long-term liability will be further away (since bonds can be resold, dependent on interest rate)

---
## C. Income Statement
- "is the video" that tells us the story of usually an entire year
- how much money did the corporation make
	- summarizes a company's revenue and expenses over a period of time (has a beginning an an end)
- account of all the profit and loss that the company incurs
	- what is the firm's net income?

- Main Components
	- Revenue
	- Expenses
#### Terminology / Format
- (+) Net Sales (a.k.a. Revenue)
	- all the money that the company receives in the course of its business

- (+) Other Income

- (-) Cost of Good Sold (COGS) / Cost of Services (COS)
	- includes gas, *raw materials*, employee wages (cashier, chefs etc.)
	- are directly attributable to a sale of a product or good

- (-) Selling, general & administrative expense (SG&A)
	- costs of marketing or advertising, hiring a CEO, costs of corporate office
	- costs incurred **regardless** of net sales (not attributable)

- (-) Depreciation Expense (non-accumulative, only for the current fiscal year)
	- Earnings before Interest and Income Tax (EBIT) $\implies$ result of all of above amount (Revenue + Other Income - CoGS - SG&A - Depreciation)

- (-) Interest Expense
- (-) Taxes
- Net Income (the subtotal)

### Slide 21 Example
a) Find out the Taxable income based on the tax rate
$$
\begin{aligned}
	\text{Given 20\% corp tax rate, taxable income} &= \frac{2000}{20} \times 100 = 10,000 \\
	\text{Taxable Income = texable income - taxes paid} &= 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000
\end{aligned}
$$

b) Revenue  (add back all the expenses made by the company)

c) `EBIT = Revenue - Cost - Depreciation`
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{EBIT } = 23,000 - \text{CoGS, Expenses and Depreciation} &= 23,000 - 8,000 - 3,000 - 1,000 = 11,000
\end{aligned}
$$
