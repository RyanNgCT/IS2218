If we come across any financial report, it will usually contain:
- Balance Sheet
- Income Statement
- Cash Flow Statement
## A. The Balance Sheet
- shows the value of the firm's assets and liabilities at a particular time
- "take a photograph" of everything in the Holland Village Restaurant
- assets are arranged in **top-down decreasing liquidity** (how readily you can convert something to cash)
	- cash is the most liquid (cash is at the top)
	- things like land and property is not very liquid (needs a long process to be converted to cash)
		- liquidity depends on the surrounding context itself as well

- there are guidelines of how assets should be reported (in preparation for audit). Any assets listed in the balance sheet must fulfil the following criteria
	1. Has to come out of a previous transaction
	2. Future Value

- can be expressed as a common size balance sheet $\implies$ transform everything into a percentage
#### Terminology
- `LESS`: deduct the amount
- `issue`: a bond / loan: means that the company's liability increases
### Components
#### Assets
LHS contains assets (i.e. the investments) $\implies$ broken down into current and fixed assets
- Raw materials, ingredients, utensils, fans, tables and chairs, equipment, supplies, land
- Cash
- Receivables are also called Account Receivables (it is an asset)
	- Good in a B2C setting because things are done in credit (IOUs)
	
- Inventory
	- Raw Material: meat and vegetables that require processing before being sold
	- Work-In-Progress: still in the processing stage
	- Finished Goods: ready to be served to the customer

- Other current assets
	- ones that we fail to classify into the previous few categories
		- rent being paid in advanced for the next fiscal year
		- payment of employees trip's $\implies$ employees creating value for the corporation
		- prepayments

- Fixed Assets 
	- not involved in day-to-day, but is what is being used to create value
	- Tangible - Equipment
		- Notable Category: Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) is the original purchase price of **all the assets** that the corporation owns
			- less accumulated depreciation $\implies$ value of the asset after $x$ numbers of years usually decreases ("lost value"), **is a cumulative number** $\sum$ from the start of the company's existence
			- the course focuses on straight line depreciation (i.e. a fix decrement in value across time)
			- when the value of the asset hit zero, then there is no need to include it into the balance sheet

	- Intangible - Michelin star, R&D etc.

Goodwill (as an intangible asset) $\implies$ is recorded in the purchasing company's balance sheet, in the case of acquisitions and mergers

#### Liability
RHS is how we are financing whatever we have bought (the liabilities and equity)
- main components being liability (what we owe a bank or any debt-holder) and shareholder's equity (what is left in the company)
	- we can pay off the liabilities

- current liabilities / accounts payable are due within a short term, usually one year
	- usually what we owe suppliers
	- in exchange, we obtain something tangible in return (i.e. some raw ingredients, or a university education for one semester, unearned revenue)

- short-term debt
	- bank loan
	
- long-term liability 
	- can be long-term repeated bank loans or housing payment
	- can also be bonds that the company has issued

#### Shareholder equity
Is made up of the following three components:
- common stock and paid-in capital
	- example being IPO (initial share price)
	- common stock is held by corporation shareholders

- treasury stock
	- all the stocks that the company buys back to shareholders

- retained earnings
	- net income that goes back to the company (net income goes into retained earnings)
	- the amount we reinvest into the company after paying for dividends $\implies$ any dividends issued to shareholders are subtracted from here

> *def:* An asset is investment, or something that produces cash in the future

> *def* Leverage of a company is when its liabilities are higher than equity

> Accounting Equation: $A = L + E$

Either $L \downarrow \: E \downarrow$  or $L \uparrow \: E \downarrow$

## B. Book Value and Market Values
**Book Value:** the value of assets or liabilities according to balance sheet
- based on the historical costs and adjusted for depreciation.

**Market Value:** the value of asset or liability when resold in a market
- is forward-looking, based on the future value of assets

Generally Accepted Accounting Practices $\implies$ use book value / historical costs

Is Shareholders Equity = Share Price?
- market value of equity is share

Liability depends on the prevailing interest rates (usually book value $\lt$ market value)
- short-term liability will be closer to the book value
- long-term liability will be further away (since bonds can be resold, dependent on interest rate)

---
## C. Income Statement
- "is the video" that tells us the story
- how much money did the corporation make
- account of all the profit and loss that the company incurs
	- what is the firm's net income?
#### Terminology / Format
- (+) Net Sales (a.k.a. Revenue)
- (+) Other Income
- (-) Cost of Good Sold (COGS)
- (-) Selling, general & administrative expense (SG&A)
	- costs of marketing, hiring a CEO, costs of corporate office
	- costs incurred regardless of net sales (not attributable)

- (-) Depreciation Expense (non-accumulative, only for the current fiscal year)
- Earnings before Interest and Income Tax (EBIT) $\implies$ result of all of above amount

- (-) Interest Expense
- (-) Taxes
- Net Income (the subtotal)

### Slide 21 Example
a) Find out the Taxable income based on the tax rate
$$
\begin{aligned}
	\text{Given 20\% corp tax rate, taxable income} &= \frac{2000}{20} \times 100 = 10,000 \\
	\text{Taxable Income = texable income - taxes paid} &= 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000
\end{aligned}
$$

b) Revenue  (add back all the expenses made by the company)

c) `EBIT = Revenue - Cost - Depreciation`
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{EBIT } = 23,000 - \text{CoGS, Expenses and Depreciation} &= 23,000 - 8,000 - 3,000 - 1,000 = 11,000
\end{aligned}
$$
