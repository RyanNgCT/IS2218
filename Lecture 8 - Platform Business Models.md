## Introduction
- cover both platforms and business fundamentals (combining business with technology)

- traditional system employed most by a business is a pipeline, which involves a supply chain
	- there are a lot of fixed costs coming into play for a business
#### Stages of the Linear Value Chain
1. Design
2. Manufacture
3. Sell
4. Deliver
- each portion of the value chain takes place before another

- increasingly, more and more businesses now adopt a platform structure
	- platform structure: different types of users (consumers and producers)
## The Advantage of Platforms
1. removing all the gatekeepers
	- *anyone can publish* a book on a platform (i.e. to Kindle) $\implies$ traditionally gatekept by a few publishing companies
	- gatekeepers are replaced by market signals
	- consumers have more freedom

2. new sources of value and supply
	- platforms don't actually down the assets (i.e. Airbnb doesn't own the house)
	- Rise of the Sharing Economy (borrowing DVDs versus using Netflix to stream content)
	- new sources of value created through utility of idle assets

3. Community Feedback Loops
	- comments to signal content quality (i.e. YouTube)
	- purchase reviews

- focus has shifted *from broadcast to (market) segmentation*, then to virality and social influence
## Network Effects*
- Key Takeaway

> **Network Effects** is the impact that the number of users of a platform has on the value created for each user
- able to create value and connections when we have $\geq 2$ nodes
- phenomenon of network effects does not happen in any other business models
	- is there an additional utility for the community if another person has a Rolls Royce
	- if we have a telephone, every additional telephone exponentially increases the number of possible connections that we can have

- network effects can be negative

- Industrial revolution promoted supply economies of scale ($\uparrow$ scale $\downarrow$ cost in traditional business model)

- Catering to different tastes or preferences of people

- Network Effects differs quite differently from price effects and brand effects
	- brand effect is more sticky than price effects
	- we are choosing grab not because it is the cheapest, but rather we have the greatest reach to all drivers

- Virality can attract people, but network effects keep them there

- It is more important for firms to be able to scale seamlessly and easily
#### One-Sided
- effect of having one additional user on the others
#### Two-Sided
- we have two main classifications
	- i.e. for Grab, we have both more drivers and riders (they depend on each other)
	- participants (on either side) would not leave the platform

- firms with this model can **spend money** to attract participants to one side of the market and achieve the network effects
#### Positive Network Effects
- when we have more drivers, drivers spread out
- driver downtime reduces
- prices are lower
- more customers join uber and there is more demand for uber services

##### Positive, Same-side

##### Positive, Cross-side
#### Negative Network Effects
- when we have issues of matchmaking (difficulties matching when number are high)
	- participants will leave if we don't do matching properly
	- utility of the platforms can also drop

##### Negative, Same-side
- the effect of competition on the same side (of the user)
##### Negative, Cross-side
- Having more men on the dating platform affects the quality of men that women can choose from
## Monetization
- monetization is a **tricky problem to solve**
	- inherent value of platform business lies in the creation of network effects (we have more people there)
	- some charges will make the number of people present decreases
		- discourages user participation on the platforms

- what are sources of value
	- access to curation mechanisms that enhance quality of interactions
	- access to tools that facilitate interaction
		- make sure everyone keeps the end of their bargain

	- *for consumers:* access to value created on platform
	- *for producers:* access to a community or market

- While network effects can lead to increased monetization, sometimes, the opposite effect can happen if network effects are negative

#### Transaction
1. Since only a transaction is charged, buyers and sellers are not discouraged to join
2. Ensure that there is at least a bit of trust
#### Charging for Access
- charge producers to access certain communities of users
#### Charging for Enhanced Access
- get additional details by paying a subscription fee
#### Charging for Enhanced Curation
- improve quality of interactions for those who pay a premium price
- enhanced vetting or screening of service providers
- transaction to subscription: access to all courses for a period of time
#### Whom to Charge?
- do we charge all users or we charge one side while subsidizing another side
### Case Study: X
Pre-Elon Twitter:
- 80% Ads, 20% API Access
## Metrics
- Metrics of the Pipeline Model
	- overall focus of metrics used in the traditional pipeline business models is the efficiency with which values flows through a pipeline
		- produce goods and services efficiently in sufficient numbers to meet demands (operations)

- Most important Metric: Rate of Retraction Success

#### Metrics during the Start Up Phase
1. Liquidity
2. Matching Quality
3. Trust
4. Platform Specific Metrics
## The Future
- Industries that can resist disruption by platforms
