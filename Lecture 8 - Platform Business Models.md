## Introduction
- cover both platforms and business fundamentals (combining business with technology)
	- answer the question: What is so special about platforms?

- traditional system employed most by a business is a pipeline, which involves a supply chain
	- there are a lot of **fixed costs** coming into play for a business
		- operational costs
		- land and building (i.e. space, cost of construction, cost of applying for the land and company to be approved)
	- time (opportunity costs)
#### Stages of the Linear Value Chain
**Example: Apple**
1. *Design:* design the iPhone in California
2. *Manufacture:* manufacture the parts in China, Vietnam, Cambodia etc.
3. *Sell:* iPhones are sold all over the world in brick-and-mortar and online stored
4. *Deliver* the product
- each portion of the above value chain takes place before another

- increasingly, more and more businesses now adopt a **platform structure**
	- platform structure: different types of users (we have both consumers and producers and some play both roles at the certain times)
		- users will exchange, consume and sometimes co-create something of value to the other party

	- $\sim 70\%$ of apps on one's mobile phone are platforms
## The Advantage of Platforms
As compared to traditional business, we can:
1. **Remove all the gatekeepers**
	- *anyone can publish* a book on a platform (i.e. to Kindle) $\implies$ traditionally gatekept by a few publishing companies and author's expected to have a certain pedigree / reputation
	- gatekeepers are replaced by market signals
		- market will decide on whether the books written by a particular author are good or bad (based on consumer feedback and opinion)
	- consumers have more freedom of choice in picking what kind of book or education they want (i.e. Coursera versus University)

2. **New sources of value and supply**
	- platforms don't actually down the assets (i.e. Airbnb doesn't own the house, but it expands or scales better than Marriott Group)
		- expansion of platform companies is less risky as compared to traditional businesses, since platforms often don't directly own the assets

	- Rise of the *Sharing Economy* (borrowing DVDs versus using Netflix to stream content)
		- *new sources of value* created through **utility of idle assets** in platform business models
		- long tail phenomenon: for a small group of products, the demand is very high
			- leverage the fact that we can have *significant profits* by selling **low volumes of hard to find items** instead of a large volume of a reduced number of popular items (i.e. limited edition $\text{XYZ}$)
			- ultimately, we want to have **demand pooling** to a central location
			- same idea of how the IMDB scores of most Netflix movies are below average, as compared to those in cinemas
				- demand for a certain taste $\implies$ cannot be catered to in cinemas, but can do so on Netflix

3. **Community Feedback Loops**
	- comments to signal content quality (i.e. YouTube)
	- purchase reviews
	- the market basically decides the quality of the product or service rendered on the particular platform

- focus has shifted *from broadcast to (market) segmentation*, then to virality and social influence
- allows company to quickly scale with the right resources
## Network Effects*
- Is the Key Takeaway for this lecture (is what separate platform models from the rest)

> **Network Effects** is the impact that the number of users of a platform has on the value created for each user
- able to create value and connections when we have $\geq 2$ nodes communicating with each other (i.e. two telephones versus one)
	- for $n$ nodes, we have $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ or $\begin{pmatrix}n \\ 2\end{pmatrix}$ connections
- phenomenon of network effects *does not happen* in any other business models
	- as there are **more and more people** using the platform, then we exponentially more value created / utility of the platform
	- is there an *additional utility* for the community if another person has a Rolls Royce? $\implies$ Not really (has a minor impact, as compared to the telephone model)
	- if we have a telephone, every additional telephone exponentially increases the number of possible connections that we can have

- network effects can be *positive or negative*
	- usually it is positive (w.r.t. discussions)

- The Industrial revolution promoted supply economies of scale ($\uparrow$ scale $\downarrow$ *unit cost* in traditional business model)
	- as quantities increase, cost per unit decrease
	- have a different kind of scaling in the age of the Internet: demand economies of scaling
		- done so by **catering to different tastes** or preferences of people (based on genre of movies etc.)

- Network Effects differs quite differently from price effects and brand effects
	- brand effect is **more sticky** than price effects
	- we are choosing grab not because it is the cheapest, but rather we have the greatest reach to all drivers
#### One-Sided
- effect of having one additional user on the other users of the platform
- rarely the case of today's platforms
#### Two-Sided
- we have (usually) two main classifications of "groups" on the platform
	- i.e. for Grab, we have both more drivers and riders (they depend on each other)
	- participants (on either side) would not leave the platform

- firms with this model can **spend money initially** to attract participants to one side of the market and achieve the network effects on the platform

- Network Effects in this case will differ quite a bit from price and brand effects
- Virality can attract people, but network effects keep them there
- It is more important for firms to be able to scale seamlessly and easily
#### Positive Network Effects
- when we have more drivers, drivers spread out
- driver downtime reduces
- prices are lower
- more customers join Uber and there is more demand for Uber services
##### Positive, Same-side

##### Positive, Cross-side
#### Negative Network Effects
- when we have issues of matchmaking (difficulties matching when number are high)
	- participants will leave if we don't do matching properly
	- utility of the platforms can also drop

##### Negative, Same-side
- the effect of competition on the same side (of the user)
##### Negative, Cross-side
- Having more men on the dating platform affects the quality of men that women can choose from
## Monetization
- monetization is a **tricky problem to solve**
	- inherent value of platform business lies in the creation of network effects (we have more people there)
	- some charges will make the number of people present decreases
		- discourages user participation on the platforms

- what are sources of value
	- access to curation mechanisms that enhance quality of interactions
	- access to tools that facilitate interaction
		- make sure everyone keeps the end of their bargain

	- *for consumers:* access to value created on platform
	- *for producers:* access to a community or market

- While network effects can lead to increased monetization, sometimes, the opposite effect can happen if network effects are negative

#### Transaction
1. Since only a transaction is charged, buyers and sellers are not discouraged to join
2. Ensure that there is at least a bit of trust
#### Charging for Access
- charge producers to access certain communities of users
#### Charging for Enhanced Access
- get additional details by paying a subscription fee
#### Charging for Enhanced Curation
- improve quality of interactions for those who pay a premium price
- enhanced vetting or screening of service providers
- transaction to subscription: access to all courses for a period of time
#### Whom to Charge?
- do we charge all users or we charge one side while subsidizing another side
### Case Study: X
Pre-Elon Twitter:
- 80% Ads, 20% API Access
## Metrics
- Metrics of the Pipeline Model
	- overall focus of metrics used in the traditional pipeline business models is the efficiency with which values flows through a pipeline
		- produce goods and services efficiently in sufficient numbers to meet demands (operations)

- Most important Metric: Rate of Retraction Success

#### Metrics during the Start Up Phase
1. Liquidity
2. Matching Quality
3. Trust
4. Platform Specific Metrics
## The Future
- Industries that can resist disruption by platforms
