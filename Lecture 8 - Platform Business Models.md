## Introduction
- cover both platforms and business fundamentals (combining business with technology)
	- answer the question: What is so special about platforms?

- traditional system employed most by a business is a pipeline, which involves a supply chain
	- there are a lot of **fixed costs** coming into play for a business
		- operational costs
		- land and building (i.e. space, cost of construction, cost of applying for the land and company to be approved)
	- time (opportunity costs)

- revenue generated is based on **commission on the sales** it facilitates
- many companies with the highest market capitalization benefit from competitive advantages from two-sided network effects
#### Stages of the Linear Value Chain
**Example: Apple**
1. *Design:* design the iPhone in California
2. *Manufacture:* manufacture the parts in China, Vietnam, Cambodia etc.
3. *Sell:* iPhones are sold all over the world in brick-and-mortar and online stored
4. *Deliver* the product
- each portion of the above value chain takes place before another

- increasingly, more and more businesses now adopt a **platform structure**
	- platform structure: different types of users (we have both consumers and producers and some play both roles at the certain times)
		- users will exchange, consume and sometimes co-create something of value to the other party

	- $\sim 70\%$ of apps on one's mobile phone are platforms
## The Advantage of Platforms
As compared to traditional business, we can:
1. **Remove all the gatekeepers**
	- *anyone can publish* a book on a platform (i.e. to Kindle) $\implies$ traditionally gatekept by a few publishing companies and author's expected to have a certain pedigree / reputation
	- gatekeepers are replaced by market signals
		- market will decide on whether the books written by a particular author are good or bad (based on consumer feedback and opinion)
	- consumers have more freedom of choice in picking what kind of book or education they want (i.e. Coursera versus University)

2. **New sources of value and supply**
	- platforms don't actually down the assets (i.e. Airbnb doesn't own the house, but it expands or scales better than Marriott Group)
		- expansion of platform companies is less risky as compared to traditional businesses, since platforms often don't directly own the assets
		- have as big, if not bigger market valuation compared to their traditional competitors

	- Rise of the *Sharing Economy* (borrowing DVDs versus using Netflix to stream content)
		- *new sources of value* created through **utility of idle assets** in platform business models
		- these are secondary, not primary network effects

3. **Community Feedback Loops**
	- comments to signal content quality (i.e. YouTube)
	- purchase reviews, movie reviews (i.e. Fast and Furious divides opinions)
	- the market basically decides the quality of the product or service rendered on the particular platform

- focus has shifted *from broadcast to (market) segmentation*, then to virality and social influence
- allows company to quickly scale with the right resources

 **The long tail phenomenon:** 
 - for a small group of given products, the demand is very high
- leverage the fact that we can have *significant profits* by selling **low volumes of hard to find items** instead of a large volume of a reduced number of popular items (i.e. limited edition $\text{XYZ}$)
- ultimately, we want to have ==**demand pooling** to a certain location== (i.e. more niche movies on Netflix or streaming platforms instead)
- same idea of how the IMDB scores of most Netflix movies are below average, as compared to those in cinemas
	- demand for a certain taste (i.e. independent movie but some not so popular director) $\implies$ cannot be catered to in cinemas, but can do so on Netflix
## Network Effects*
- Is the *key takeaway* for this lecture (is what separate platform models from the rest)

> **Network Effects** is the impact that the number of users of a digital platform has on the value created for each user
- able to create value and connections when we have $\geq 2$ nodes communicating with each other (i.e. two telephones versus one)
	- for $n$ nodes, we have $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ or $\begin{pmatrix}n \\ 2\end{pmatrix}$ connections
- phenomenon of network effects *does not happen* in any other business models
	- as there are **more and more people** using the platform, then we **exponentially more value** created **for users** / utility of the platform (the service becomes more valuable to me when there are more users) $\implies$ cross-side network effects
		- markets usually don't work like that since there is competition
	- is there an *additional utility* for the community if another person has a Rolls Royce? $\implies$ Not really (has a minor impact, as compared to the telephone model)
	- if we have a telephone, every additional telephone exponentially increases the number of possible connections that we can have

- network effects can be *positive or negative*
	- usually it is positive

- The Industrial revolution promoted supply economies of scale ($\uparrow$ scale or production $\downarrow$ *unit cost* in traditional business model)
	- as quantities increase, cost per unit decrease (i.e. hard disk with larger capacity are cheaper per gigabyte)
	- have a different kind of scaling in the age of the Internet: *demand economies of scale* $\implies$ bigger networks that are more valuable
		- done so by **catering to different tastes** or preferences of people (based on genre of movies etc.)
	- we want to make more money by enhancing the scale of the business

![economies-of-scale](../assets/economies-of-scale.png)
#### One-Sided
- effect of having **one additional user** on the other users of the platform
	- telephone
	- everyone using the `.pdf` or `.xlsx` formats (can read each other's files in a standard format)
	- Instagram (like and comment, share pictures)

- rarely the case of today's platforms
#### Two-Sided
- we have (usually) two main classifications of "groups" on the platform
	- i.e. for Grab, we have both more drivers and riders (they depend on each other)

- we not only have a network effect of having more users, but we have more riders (customers) for the drivers to do business for and more drivers to cater to the increase in riders as well

- firms with this model can **spend money initially** to attract participants to one side of the market and achieve the network effects on the platform
	- Grab giving discounts to attract participants to one side of the market
	- participants (on either side) would not want leave the platform  because of the Network Effects $\implies$ riders / customers will still use the Grab app despite the high price due to the large network of drivers who can potentially pick them up (get their ride to the destination faster)

- Network Effects in this case will ==**differ** quite a bit from *price and brand effects*==
	- Price Effects: 
		- will quickly fade away, is not for the longer term, quite temporal and transactional in nature
		- once we stop being the cheapest, people stop buying from us (any increase from a "base price" in the consumer's mind would lead to a **lower demand** from the consumer)
		- i.e. discount pricing when we have an increase in short term volume
	
	- Brand Effects: 
		- brand effect is **more sticky** than price effects (i.e. customer has some sort of loyalty, having used a product or service before)
		- we are choosing Grab not because it is the cheapest, but rather we have the greatest reach to all drivers

- Virality can attract people, but network effects keep them there

- It is more important for firms to be able to scale seamlessly and easily
	- Google PageRank algorithm is much better than Yahoo's Human Edited Database (must higher more people in order to scale well)

- need to take into account Network Effects at the **planning stage** of our product or service (the start of the project)

- having more people on the other end (of a two-sided network) can have both positive and negative cross-side effects
#### Positive Network Effects
**Example: Uber**
- when we have more drivers, drivers spread out across geographies
	- driver downtime reduces because we have more customers in multiple regions
	- *Alt.* more drivers in a certain geographical location means that pickups are faster $\implies$ more demand
- prices are lower
- more customers join Uber and there is *more demand* for Uber services

![positive-network-effects](../assets/positive-network-effects.png)
##### Positive, Same-side
- ref above, having more drivers reduces the downtime for other drivers as well
- i.e. Facebook, telephone, WhatsApp and communication companies
##### Positive, Cross-side
- ref above, faster pickups (affects the rider's experience as well)
- i.e. when we have more customers using Visa and Mastercard, then more merchants need to have these POS systems for payments $\implies$ increase the convenience and choices for users
	- as opposed to using AMEX cards which fewer merchants accept as a mode of payment
#### Negative Network Effects
- when we have issues of matchmaking (difficulties matching when number are high)
	- **participants will leave** if we don't do matching properly and the number of people in the network are high
		- want to be matched with *"people at my level"* $\implies$ people getting bored and are **not getting what they want**
		- just need to find one of these matches as other ones will be of zero value
	- utility of the platforms can also drop and network effects will decrease exponentially if not managed well

- not only getting people into the network, but also to make sure that the user experience is good on the platform

- we can have a certain case study which has both negative same-side and negative cross-side at the same time.
![negative-network-effects](../assets/negative-network-effects.png)
##### Negative, Same-side
- the ==**effect of competition** on the same side== of the network
	- i.e. having more drivers on Uber as an Uber Driver presents more competition for service and quality of rides etc.
	- i.e. more users joining Airbnb results in increasing prices
- $\exists$ some form of scarcity in the network for the other side
##### Negative, Cross-side
- Having more men on the dating platform affects the quality of men that women can choose from
- matching problems and clutter on one end of the network as opposed to another end
- this effect is slightly different from *negative, same side*
	- having one additional man means more competition on the same side
	- having one additional man means the quality of men which women on the other side can pick from is also affected
## Monetization
- In Corporate Governance, the goal of the company is to **improve shareholder value** as we need to make money

- **monetization** of platform business models and more broadly, **network effects** is a **tricky problem to solve**
	- inherent value of platform business lies in the creation of network effects (we have more people there) $\implies$ do we need to have a *certain price tag* associated with the value generated by this platform model?

	- how do we make money without compromising on network effects?

	- some charges will make the number of people present decreases
		- **charging for usage**: discourages user participation on the platforms
		- **charging for consumption:** affect consumption, affects producers
		- **charging for production:** reduces value creation $\implies$ affects consumers

- ⚠️ we should ensure that we have enough network effects as a platform before charging for the platform services via monetization.
	- if we start to monetize a platform, we have a lot of losses in the first few years, but have a high share price $\implies$ share price is a reflection of **future** profits
##### What are sources of value on the platform?
- **Consumers:**
	-  access to value created on platform
	
- **Producers:**
	- access to a community or market (i.e. Airbnb hosts)

- **Both:** 
	- access to tools and services that facilitate interaction between parties (is usually a feature)
		- platform needs to make sure everyone keeps the end of their bargain

	- access to *curation mechanisms* that enhance quality of interactions across the two sides

- While network effects can lead to increased monetization, sometimes, the **opposite effect** can happen if network effects are negative
- charging a price may in some cases help to reduce negative network effects
	- i.e. Meetup which started charging $19/month for the right to keep the service on the organizer's end
	- end up having fewer meetups, but more of them being successful  and productive (company still earns a profit from these successful transactions or sales as well)
#### Transaction Fees
1. Since only a transaction is charged, buyers and sellers are not discouraged to join
2. Platforms need to experiment with various levels of the fee
3. Platforms should provide other value added benefits if users are seen to be taking activities outside of the platform itself.
	1. Ensure that there is at least a bit of trust from the customer, to enable customer retention
#### Charging for Access
- charge producers to access certain communities of users
- does not discourage users (consumers and producers) from joining
	- does not affect an individual's network effect
- just having an additional feature
	- charging recruiters to be able to present job opportunities to potential job seekers
	- charging companies for the ability to compare and target various professionals based on their resumes
$$
\begin{aligned}
\\\\
\end{aligned}
$$
#### Charging for Enhanced Access
- get additional information or data by paying a subscription fee (i.e. a Premium Feature in a Freemium model)
	- pay per view
	- i.e. Google AdWords
		- important for customers to distinguish between content that has been elevated via paid access
		- important to limit sponsored posts so that platform still remain relevant rather than cluttered

- charge users by lowering barriers
	- view profile for free but provide additional information for those who pay a subscription fee
#### Charging for Enhanced Curation
- improve quality of interactions for those who pay a premium price
- **enhanced vetting or screening** of service providers (make sure the product is premium or the provider of the service is not a siao lang)
- transaction to subscription: access to all courses for a period of time (enhanced value upon payment of a subscription fee)
#### Whom to Charge?
- do we charge *all users* or we charge one side while subsidizing another side?
	- charging all users is rare, as it could reduce overall network effects
	- could be used as a vetting process however, to ensure the quality of players from both sides of the network

- usually instead go about charging one side of the platform while subsidizing the other end
	- i.e. ladies night in bars

- alternatively can charge most users the full price while subsidizing those who are the top performers in the platform

- have **price discrimination** based on price sensitivity
	- discussed in the pricing topic at the end

#### Monetization Principles
1. Avoid **charging for value** that users have **previously received for free**
	1. other platforms may "die" if they start changing customers what they previously could access for free (i.e. change the nature of their offering from free to all $\to$ pay for access)
	2. people will be angry about it as the additional cost is not justified $\implies$ want to make sure that the **network effects remain unchanged**

2. Avoid reducing access to value that customers have already been customed to receive

3. Strive to create **additional value** that **justifies** the **charges** imposed
	1. Negative E.g.: Uber receiving criticisms for a safe rides fee for conducting background checks on drivers and allegedly cutting corners
	2. Negative E.g.: charging for instantaneous access of tweets instead of a freemium version whereby we have a cooldown or delay of 10 mins etc. $\implies$ should not take away from value they enjoy right now (refer to main point $1$)

4. Monetization Strategies should be considered when making the **initial platform choices**
	1. If charging transaction fee $\implies$ platform must be able to control transaction (reverse if necessary, make sure the transaction does not happen outside of the platform)
		1. need not start monetization immediately, but need to have the resources and the means to do so in future if it is planned for
	2. If charging for access $\implies$ platform should be able to control avenues where content reaches users and the flow of user data as well
	3. Charging for Enhanced Access (i.e. on top of the usual access that one has on the X platform)
		1. pay money to talk to celebrities if they don't follow the customer on X
		2. pay for the verified tick (i.e. used to be given to celebrities, instead of "buying" it)
			1. does not verify the authenticity of the user
		3. pay to increase the word or character limit
		4. pay for dark mode
		5. used to be 80% Ads, 20% API Access on X, so we can charge for API use
			1. used to be publicly available versus being paywalled

## Metrics
- **Metrics for the Traditional Pipeline Model**
	- overall focus of metrics used in the traditional pipeline business models is the efficiency with which values flows through a pipeline
		- produce goods and services efficiently in sufficient numbers to meet demands *(operations)*
		- reach customers through proper channels with appropriate pricing *(marketing)*
		- ensure adequate revenues generated to produce profits and value for shareholders *(finance)*

	- some common metrics include: cash flows, inventory turnovers, operating income, gross margins, overhead (i.e. SG&A, which is not directly attributable to the sale), ROI etc.

- **Metrics for Platforms**
	- can use metrics like cash flow, operating income
	- However, metrics like inventory is not really suited since the platform business may not actually own the asset, as alluded to earlier.
		- value is created through **network effects**, rather than tangible quantifiable indicators

	- Most important Metric: *Rate of Interaction Success*
		- most of the metrics should point to this
		- focus should be on metrics that **quantify the success in generating desirable interactions** between platform participants

	- should be actionable (clear guidance for strategic decisions and can take actionable steps), accessible (comprehensible for those wo need to use the info) and auditable

	- metrics should measure # of happy customers on each side of the network who repeatedly engage in value creating interactions
#### Metrics during the Start-up Phase
1. **Liquidity**
	- ensure that we have a **minimum number of participants** (producers and consumers), so that network effects kick in as a result of interaction between these parties
		- using websites like *Statista* to determine the **number of active users** on a particular, more popularly use platform
	- use the tracking of listings that lead to interactions and/or transactions for a given time period
		- focus on the active usage rather than the # sign ups for the platform
		- can use *ratios* and comparative metrics
			- $\text{\# active to total ratio} = \frac{\text{Active users}}{\text{Total users}}$
			- $\text{Rate of growth of Active Users} = \frac{\text{NEW Active users}}{\text{Total Active users}}$

2. **Matching Quality**
	- ensure *accuracy of matching algorithms*, dependent on the curation of material & content
		- experience of users on the platform is good
	- can do so by measuring the **percentages of searches leading to actual interactions** measured through the $\text{Sales Conversion Rate} = \frac{\text{Searchers leading to interaction}}{\text{Total searches}}$

	- measure the *correlation* between interaction rate and long-term activity rate to come up with a threshold or baseline metric
		- i.e. majority of users who experience interaction percentage is higher than 40% during their first week on the platform and who remain active members for $\geq 3$ months $\implies$ used to feedback into and enhance network effects
		- platform actually has a higher interaction percentage or sales conversion rate (allows the platform to benefit)

3. **Trust**
	- enables for a degree in which users are *comfortable with level of risk* associated with interactions on the platform
		- i.e. curation of products (i.e. photos of house type and amenities in Airbnb homes are legitimate)
	
	- is critical for platforms where people may interact with each other for the very first time (relationship building amongst network segments)
		- ensure that both sides review each other (both the hosts and the the ones being hosted)

4. **Platform Specific Metrics**
	- $\exists$ a range of metrics to measure commitment to the ecosystem
		- i.e. time between interactions (downtime of idle resources) and % of active users

	- outcome-based metrics (usually for multi-sided)
		- Number of nights booked on Airbnb
		- Number of work hours on platforms like Upwork
		- Number of rides per day on Grab

	- content-creation metrics (usually for social media and content creation platforms)
		- consumer relevance (% of positive reviews for listing from customers)
		- co-creation (% of listing with some minimum level of positive response from potential customers)

	- market access regardless of complete interaction
		- \# women registered in dating sites
		- restaurant reservation (does not matter if it is followed through)
#### Metrics during the Growth Phase
There is a need to use a different set of metrics after the start-up has amassed a large group of users to ensure that it is growing well (as ran by the managers of the company).

Need to balance the needs of both consumers and producers alike, using metrics like:
- **producer-to-consumer ratio**
- **interaction conversion rate** (% of searches converted to interactions for the platform) $\implies$ similar to in the start-up phase
- health of user base: using the **side switching rate** (i.e. go from being consumers $\to$ producers)

1. Producer-Side
	- frequency of producer participation
	- listings created by producers
	- outcomes achieved by producers

	- platform needs to monitor interaction failure (searchers to interaction, but failed interactions and/or transactions)
	- producer fraud (failure to deliver a product as advertised)
	- retention and lifetime value metrics, similar to traditional businesses
		- repeated producers on the platform $\implies$ usually are profitable so stay on the platform
		- churn rates (% of producers who stop doing business) should be low

2. Consumer-Side
	- frequency of consumption, searches
	- rate of conversion to sale (% of click-throughs that result in interactions)
	- consumer retention and lifetime benefits
		- promotion of customer loyalty and reducing churn
#### Metrics during the Maturity Phase
We usually don't have new sources of revenue or growth opportunities during this phase (should try to adapt instead)
1. Driving Innovation
	- platform needs to adapt to needs of users and changes in the competitive & regulatory env
		- i.e. Microsoft Windows absorbing apps once provided by stand-alone companies and integrate it into the OS
		- has to be done with care to avoid scaring the ecosystem (good integration)

2. Incorporate 3rd party feature that provides a large share of value enjoyed by users that rivals competitor (i.e. Apple Maps, in response to Google Maps)

---
## The Future
Types of businesses to join the platform revolution:
1. *Information-intensive Industries:* value information highly and require platforms as information enablers
2. *Industries w Non-scalable Gatekeepers:* i.e. Publishing Industries with only a few publishers
3. *Highly-fragmented industries:* market aggregation increases efficiency and reduces search costs
4. *Industries w extreme information asymmetries:* Carfax, which provides information to car buyers on more information about the condition and history of cars sold by dealers

Industries that can resist disruption by platforms
1. *High regulatory control:* Banking, Education, Healthcare, those that deal with PII which should not be open on the Internet
2. *High Failure Costs:* i.e. matching a patient to the wrong doctor
3. *Resource Intensive Industries* like Mining, Oil, gas and agriculture (need access to resources to maintain large scale processes)
#### Fintech companies
- money is a form of value accepted by all participants of an economic system, can also be the SGQR that one scans
- Financial Platform companies try to leverage the info they have about spending patterns of a large number of customers
- P2P lending platforms can provide cheaper loans and higher rates of interest (from the vast amount of data they collect) $\implies$ generate more revenue and value for the platform and the lender
- Personal Finance Platforms to provide users with personalized services
- Traditional Financial Institutions and Banks are beginning to use platform models
#### Logistics & Transportation companies
- platform model does not require vehicle fleet ownership, unlike more traditional logs businesses like FedEx
- Platforms can leverage aggregate real time market info about movement on physical goods and orchestrate an ecosystem of 3rd party delivery agents (i.e. in Grab and GoJek)
- Traditional Companies like Rolls Royce can scale demand for its customers (i.e. Engines for Airlines at all airports)
	- platform business ideas can also affect companies like Rolls Royce
