**Cash Flow comprises of:**
- Cash from Operations
- Cash from Financing
- Cash from Investing
## The DuPont System
- is based on a chemical company
- Profit Margin $= \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Sales}}$
- Operating profit margin = After tax operating income after sales
	- $\frac{\text{After Tax Operating Income}}{\text{sales}}$

- want to have a like-for-like comparison hence use the after tax operating income, regardless of whether they are equity or debt financed.

Fundamental way or metric to assess a company is using the ROA value
- ROA figure kind of "matches" for every dollar of asset made by the company
- ROA $= \frac{\text{After Tax Operating Income}}{\text{Assets}}$
- Can introduce $\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Sales}}$ so that the ROA does not change, then redistribute into:
$$
\begin{aligned}
ROA &= \frac{\text{After Tax Operating Income}}{\text{Assets}} \times \frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Sales}} \\\\
&=  \frac{\text{After Tax Operating Income}}{\text{Sales}}  \times \frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Assets}} \\\\
&= \text{Operational Profit Margin} \times \text{Asset Turnover}
\end{aligned}
$$
Every company either has *high turnover* (time) or *high profit* per customer (idea of profit margin versus sales volume).
### Mergers
- if purchasing supplies from supplier and they are charging a premium
	- thinking of acquiring the supplier company to spend less on supplies $\implies$ increase in ROA value.

- if we want mergers to be successful, as the client company, we need to do a better job (produce $\geq$ sales with $\downarrow$ resources used)
	- need to either increase profit margin or asset turnover of the acquired company

### ROA
- ROA metric is very powerful regardless of the company because it is between $3\% - 10\%$ across various companies (since it is a ratio)
	- most companies fit in this ballpark figure

- ROA is considering things in the income statement
	- how many money is our company generating
- Flow measure, typically consider one year
## Measuring Financial Leverage
- taking a long-term bank loan
	- increase in liabilities and assets

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Long-term debt ratio} &= \frac{\text{long-term debt}}{\text{long-term debt} + \text{equity}} = \frac{\text{long-term debt}}{\text{capitalization}} \\\\
\text{Long-term debt-equity ratio} &= \frac{\text{long-term debt}}{\text{equity}}
\end{aligned}
$$
#### ROA versus Debt
- Suppose an ROA of 10% and we borrow from the bank at Interest Rate of 5%
- The cash asset from the bank will give us a return of 10%
- In good times $\to$ food to be in debt since performing well

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Total debt ratio} &= \frac{\text{total liabilities}}{\text{total assets}} \\\\
\text{Times interest earned} &= \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{interest payments}} \\\\
\text{Cash coverage ratio} &= \frac{\text{EBIT} + \text{depreciation}}{\text{interest payments}}
\end{aligned}
$$
- ass depreciation back since depreciation does not actually deduct cash from the firm

### ROE
- Generally, $ROE = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Equity}}$
- introduce $\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Sales}}$ and $\frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Assets}}$ and $\frac{\text{after-tax op income}}{\text{fter-tax op income}}$ to obtain the formula: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{ROE} &= \frac{\text{assets}}{\text{equity}} \times \frac{\text{sales}}{\text{assets}} \times \frac{\text{after-tax operating income}}{\text{sales}} \times \frac{\text{net income}}{\text{after-tax operating income}} \\\\
&= \text{Leverage Ratio} \times \text{Asset Turnover} \times \text{Operating Profit Margin} \times \text{Debt Burden}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Cash flow statement should reflect the cash that already has been gone

- treat face value as the issuing amount
- more debt = higher ROE (rate of interest lower than the ROA)
	- above average leverage (using debt financing)

- Note that Debt-Equity ratio: $\frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Total Equity}}$
## Measuring Liquidity
- we need to have sufficient liquidity throughout the year, so as to not default on any payments
- Current ratio should be $\geq 1$. If current assets $\gt$ current liabilities, then can pay off debt more readily
- Liability is identified as 

## Interpreting Financial Ratios
- Quick ratio is a stricter ratio, where we remove accounts inventory from the numerator
- Cash ratio is even stricter, when we remove accounts receivables also (in the case of financial crises)

**Example**
- What is the total debt ratio
- Calculate Long Term debt
- Find out current liability from common ratio and current assets

**Example 2**
Walmart is more efficient (everyday low price)
Tiffany is more high-end
- calculate ROA based on the Asset Turnover and Operating Profit Margin
