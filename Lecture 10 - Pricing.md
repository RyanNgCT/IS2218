## A. Introduction
- could be very important in the workplace (w.r.t. marketing)

- 4Ps $\implies$ product, place, promotion, price
	- the rest other than price, we have to pay for
	- Price is the only $P$ concerned with how much we **get from a customer**, which goes directly to the bottom line (net income)

- How much is the buyer willing to pay for?
	- if we charge every customer the same amount, then we are not exploiting the customer enough
	- we need to charge each and every customer **based on their willingness to pay** (the maximum amount that they want to pay)

> **Pricing** is the sum of the values that customers **exchange for benefits** of having or using a product
- *Importance:* is the most tactical (short term) of the $4P$s and is the only $P$ **which brings in revenue**

- tactic vs win strategy
	- tactic is **short term in nature** while strategy is a longer-term plan

- if we want to create a new product
	- promotions are at fixed times in the year (specific timings like holidays)
	- availability of a product is very important (distribution and supply chain networks are very important to ensure the reach of products)

- the remaining of the $3P$s will take time to nurture and develop, unlike price which is instantaneous and tactical (immediate in nature)

- importance on pricing w.r.t. inflation and recession
	- how consumers cut spending

- all the other $P$s incur costs (i.e. for Apple)
	- **product:** R&D costs incurred for new products
	- **place:** *rental or ownership* of tangible asset
	- **promotion:** advertising spendings

- cost-based pricing or value-based pricing
	- look at CoGS + a small margin to obtain the price to charge (no competitive advantage)
	- better: pricing based on the subjectivity and perception of the value that customer will receive
#### Importance of Pricing
- In the cases of Inflation and Recessions
	- lower the purchasing power of people
	- recession: people cutting back on spending (sale of male underwear)

- Price changes can be dynamic $\implies$ increase or decrease of the price across time

- (Recap) **Lifetime Customer Value:** value of a customer over their lifetime to one's business
	- can make strategic and budget conscious marketing decisions to **acquire the customers**
	- don't want to acquire customers at a loss (good ROI), could be cheaper to retain existing customer base from churn than it is to lose customers
## B. Factors Influencing Price
- Economics Approach $\implies$ Supply and Demand. Charge customers at the intersection of both curves (point of equilibrium)

- Accounting $\implies$ based on *variable and fixed costs*
	- take costs (CoGS) and **add a margin** to it (usually 10 to 15%)

- Business / Marketing $\implies$ margin depends on the company's **overall strategy**
	- dependent on segmentation, targeting, positioning, products, promotions and place strategies (STP and 3Ps)
		- who are we targeting (which market segment)?
		- what kind of product do we have (common consumable versus niche products)? does product have many competitors and substitutes?
		- what are the promotion strategies (reduce price on sale)?
		- how are we delivering or distributing the product (middlemen involved that require commission)?

	- **cannot just use the cost** to the business as a **benchmark** for pricing (cannot equate cost of operations $= \sum$ price for all customers)
		- but in general, should **charge above CoGS**, lest we will make a loss
		- cost of the same product should generally not have the same pricing (since the kind of customer using each product is different $\implies$ could be from a different market segment)

- we instead ==charge customers for the **maximum that they are willing to pay**==
	- willingness to pay is **very hard to find** (customers themselves don't even know how much this figure is) $\implies$ not expected to know how to derive this in the cost

- target audience is different (market segmentation)
	- is pricing fair?

- Pricing depends on a varied group of Internal and external factors (as explored below)
### B1. Internal Factors
- there are many internal factors based on **marketing objectives, marketing-mix strategy and costs**
- Example: Grab
	- aim for market share and leadership
	- starting out, spend a lot on promotion to customers
	- experience network effects and once it is large enough, customers are reliant on Grab, then no longer need promotions for customer retention

**Marketing Objectives**
1. Survival

2. Current Profit Maximization (Short-Term)

3. Market Share Leadership
	1. use huge discounts to lower prices to entice people to join the platform to create network effects and gain market share (make it harder for new entrants as per $5$)

4. Product Quality Leadership
	1. if we are the companies with product quality leadership, we can charge a premium price which is justified by the quality of the products sold

5. Competitive Entry Barriers

6. Reseller Support (see below)

7. Cost Recovery for non-profits and public firms
	1. break even at least so as to not make a loss, don't need to make profit

**Marketing-Mix Strategy**
1. Product Design
2. Distribution
3. Promotion
4. Price vs non-price competition
5. Parallel Importers

**Costs**
#### Product Quality Leadership
- is one of the pillars for a successful business
- profit margin of shoe reseller is $\approx 99\%$ (margins are very high for resellers), almost the full margin usually
	- where we buy the shoe depends on where we place the shoe in the shop (somewhere deep in the shop vs at eye level when first enter the shop)
	- margin that reseller makes depends on what price we set
#### Price vs Non-price competition
- selling engines vs selling power
- supply the truck vs supply the supply chain solution
- want to make sure that we **compete on non-price attributes** like the selling price of a particular product, and more on delivering something that delivers value (unique selling points)
#### Parallel Importing
- sell a product **outside** the **authorized distribution and selling channels**
- i.e. buying a luxury handbag in Europe vs in Singapore
	- a.k.a. arbitrage (different prices for the same asset)
#### Costs
- floor price (costs) $\implies$ should avoid charging below CoGS to avoid making a loss overall
	- note that CoGS can include both fixed and variable costs
- ceiling price (demand), the **highest price** that we can charge
	- should not be dependent on cost, but rather, the **demand** for products and services that we can offer
	- should be a good framework for pricing model

- types of costs involved: fixed, variable, total, average, marginal
	- **marginal cost** is very difficult to find out in businesses (how much **more cost** for *one additional customer*) and calculating it is not straightforward
		- may also include additional charges by legislation (i.e. Singapore Changi Airport has additional cost per plane for each additional passenger on board)
	- viewing cost at an *operational level* in IS2218
	- can also look at costs in a corporate context (CEO's salary)
		- this salary could be partially fixed and partially variable

	- **variable costs** are costs that **have variances in each transaction**
		- in salaries and things like fuel costs
		- variable cost can be for a group of customers, while marginal cost is for a single additional customer

	- **fixed costs:** rent, insurance, depreciation, taxes

- also need to consider competitor pricing strategies and other internal and external factors to determine a good price for a product or service

#### Other Price Differentials
- people may not value super cheap products $\implies$ affects their ego and image (so not just about costs)
- willingness to pay is different at **different locations** so have different pricing for different locations
	- price may be double because of rent and the "ambience" (mark up on the base price)
	- higher rental, different customer demographics
## C. Experience and Experience Curves
- pricing also depends on the **volume of products produced** $\implies$ as it affects the production costs associated with the products
- do things in operations in a more cost-effective way with more experience
	- experience curve drives down the price of products in general (learning to cut costs of the product, despite maybe maintaining the same kind of quality perhaps)
### C1. Internal Factors
- Organization -- who sets the price?
	- the top manager
- Market and demand
### C2. External Factors Influencing Price
#### Market and Demand
- have different forms of competition
	- i.e. pure competition, monopolistic, oligopolistic etc.
- price elasticity of demand
#### Consumer Perceptions
- the price-quality relationship
	- some handbags cost as much as downpayment for house but some people see value in it
- price can be used in the absence of other cues

#### Competitors
- can be a reference point for pricing (i.e. market research leading to competitor pricing)
- Responsiveness (i.e. Pepsi vs Coke)
	- the response of competitors to price changes
	- if both lower price, then they both just lose profits
#### Other Factors


### Price Skimming
- charge a high price initially and as people willing to pay reduces, then we reduce the price for the next group of people
	- consumers wanting to try product with a lower budget can then afford it (within their budget)
- can be used when we do segmentation on price elasticity
- public image of the product and company is good
- should not reduce price $\implies$ $1 reduction in price would affect the bottom line / profit significantly, assuming that costs remain the same

- Safety/Hedge
	- cut directly from the bottom line which can severely impact revenues and profits
	- can be dangerous but since we are starting from a high price, we have more room to do the skimming

### Price Penetration
- use when when customers are price sensitive, or when the experience curve effects operatives and potential competition
