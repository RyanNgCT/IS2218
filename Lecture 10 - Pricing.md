## A. Introduction
- could be very important in the workplace (w.r.t. marketing)

- 4Ps $\implies$ product, place, promotion, price
	- the rest other than price, we have to pay for
	- Price is the only $P$ concerned with how much we **get from a customer**, which goes directly to the bottom line (net income)

- How much is the buyer willing to pay for?
	- if we charge every customer the same amount, then we are not exploiting the customer enough
	- we need to charge each and every customer **based on their willingness to pay** (the maximum amount that they want to pay)

> **Pricing** is the sum of the values that customers **exchange for benefits** of having or using a product
- *Importance:* is the most tactical (short term) of the $4P$s and is the only $P$ **which brings in revenue**

- tactic vs win strategy
	- tactic is **short term in nature** while strategy is a longer-term plan

- if we want to create a new product
	- promotions are at fixed times in the year (specific timings like holidays)
	- availability of a product is very important (distribution and supply chain networks are very important to ensure the reach of products)

- the remaining of the $3P$s will take time to nurture and develop, unlike price which is instantaneous and tactical (immediate in nature)

- importance on pricing w.r.t. inflation and recession
	- how consumers cut spending

- all the other $P$s incur costs (i.e. for Apple)
	- **product:** R&D costs incurred for new products
	- **place:** *rental or ownership* of tangible asset
	- **promotion:** advertising spendings

- cost-based pricing or value-based pricing
	- look at CoGS + a small margin to obtain the price to charge (no competitive advantage)
	- better: pricing based on the subjectivity and perception of the value that customer will receive
#### Importance of Pricing
- In the cases of Inflation and Recessions
	- lower the purchasing power of people
	- recession: people cutting back on spending (sale of male underwear)

- Price changes can be dynamic $\implies$ increase or decrease of the price across time

- (Recap) **Lifetime Customer Value:** value of a customer over their lifetime to one's business
	- can make strategic and budget conscious marketing decisions to **acquire the customers**
	- don't want to acquire customers at a loss (good ROI), could be cheaper to retain existing customer base from churn than it is to lose customers
## B. Factors Influencing Price
- Economics Approach $\implies$ Supply and Demand. Charge customers at the intersection of both curves (point of equilibrium)

- Accounting $\implies$ based on *variable and fixed costs*
	- take costs (CoGS) and **add a margin** to it (usually 10 to 15%)

- Business / Marketing $\implies$ margin depends on the company's **overall strategy**
	- dependent on segmentation, targeting, positioning, products, promotions and place strategies (STP and 3Ps)
		- who are we targeting (which market segment)?
		- what kind of product do we have (common consumable versus niche products)? does product have many competitors and substitutes?
		- what are the promotion strategies (reduce price on sale)?
		- how are we delivering or distributing the product (middlemen involved that require commission)?

	- **cannot just use the cost** to the business as a **benchmark** for pricing (cannot equate cost of operations $= \sum$ price for all customers)
		- but in general, should **charge above CoGS**, lest we will make a loss
		- cost of the same product should generally not have the same pricing (since the kind of customer using each product is different $\implies$ could be from a different market segment)

- we instead ==charge customers for the **maximum that they are willing to pay**==
	- willingness to pay is **very hard to find** (customers themselves don't even know how much this figure is) $\implies$ not expected to know how to derive this in the cost

- target audience is different (market segmentation)
	- is pricing fair?

- Pricing depends on a varied group of Internal and external factors (as explored below)
### B1. Internal Factors
- there are many internal factors based on **marketing objectives, marketing-mix strategy and costs**
- Example: Grab
	- aim for market share and leadership
	- starting out, spend a lot on promotion to customers
	- experience network effects and once it is large enough, customers are reliant on Grab, then no longer need promotions for customer retention

**Marketing Objectives**
1. Survival

2. Current Profit Maximization (Short-Term)

3. Market Share Leadership
	1. use huge discounts to lower prices to entice people to join the platform to create network effects and gain market share (make it harder for new entrants as per $5$)

4. Product Quality Leadership
	1. if we are the companies with product quality leadership, we can charge a premium price which is justified by the quality of the products sold

5. Competitive Entry Barriers

6. Reseller Support (see below)

7. Cost Recovery for non-profits and public firms
	1. break even at least so as to not make a loss, don't need to make profit

**Marketing-Mix Strategy**
1. Product Design
2. Distribution
3. Promotion
4. Price vs non-price competition
5. Parallel Importers

**Costs**
#### Product Quality Leadership
- is one of the pillars for a successful business
- profit margin of shoe reseller is $\approx 99\%$ (margins are very high for resellers), almost the full margin usually
	- where we buy the shoe depends on where we place the shoe in the shop (somewhere deep in the shop vs at eye level when first enter the shop)
	- margin that reseller makes depends on what price we set
#### Price vs Non-price competition
- selling engines vs selling power
- supply the truck vs supply the supply chain solution
- want to make sure that we **compete on non-price attributes** like the selling price of a particular product, and more on delivering something that delivers value (unique selling points)
#### Parallel Importing
- sell a product **outside** the **authorized distribution and selling channels**
- i.e. buying a luxury handbag in Europe vs in Singapore
	- a.k.a. arbitrage (different prices for the same asset)

- pricing should take into account the existence of parallel importing, if any
#### Costs
- floor price (costs) $\implies$ should avoid charging below CoGS to avoid making a loss overall
	- note that CoGS can include both fixed and variable costs
- ceiling price (demand), the **highest price** that we can charge
	- should not be dependent on cost, but rather, the **demand** for products and services that we can offer
	- should be a good framework for pricing model

- types of costs involved: fixed, variable, total, average, marginal
	- **marginal cost** is very difficult to find out in businesses (how much **more cost** for *one additional customer*) and calculating it is not straightforward
		- may also include additional charges by legislation (i.e. Singapore Changi Airport has additional cost per plane for each additional passenger on board)
	- viewing cost at an *operational level* in IS2218
	- can also look at costs in a corporate context (CEO's salary)
		- this salary could be partially fixed and partially variable

	- **variable costs** are costs that **have variances in each transaction**
		- in salaries and things like fuel costs
		- variable cost can be for a group of customers, while marginal cost is for a single additional customer

	- **fixed costs:** rent, insurance, depreciation, taxes

- also need to consider competitor pricing strategies and other internal and external factors to determine a good price for a product or service

#### Other Price Differentials
- people may not value super cheap products $\implies$ affects their ego and image (so not just about costs)
- willingness to pay is different at **different locations** so have different pricing for different locations
	- price may be double because of rent and the "ambience" (mark up on the base price)
	- higher rental, different customer demographics
## C. Experience and Experience Curves
- pricing also depends on the **volume of products produced** $\implies$ as it affects the production costs associated with the products
- do things in operations in a more cost-effective way with more experience
	- experience curve drives down the price of products in general (learning to cut costs of the product, despite maybe maintaining the same kind of quality perhaps)

- produce more goods to reduce per unit costs $\implies$ cannot associate it with a direct increase in revenue or profit margin
### C1. Internal Factors
- Organization -- who sets the price?
	- the top manager
- Market and demand
### C2. External Factors Influencing Price
#### Market and Demand
- have different forms of competition
	- i.e. pure competition, monopolistic, oligopolistic etc.
	- competitors differentiate themselves based on pricing and marketing decisions
	- monopolistic $\implies$ two companies offering products that are similar but not identical
	- monopoly $\implies$ only one source selling one particular product
- price elasticity of demand
#### Consumer Perceptions
- the price-quality relationship
	- some handbags cost as much as downpayment for house but some people see value in it
- price can be used in the absence of other cues
#### Competitors
- can be a *reference point* for pricing (i.e. market research leading to competitor pricing) $\implies$ copy the price structure or strategy of competitors when starting out
- Responsiveness (i.e. Pepsi vs Coke)
	- the response of **competitors** to **price changes**
	- if both lower price, then they both just **lose profits**

- Product Homogeneity
	- how similar are the products, which affects the price sensitivity as well
#### Other Factors
- economic conditions
- distributor reactions
	- reseller margins affected by the price (i.e. in Reseller Support as above)
- government taxes on products
	- Taxes are 60-70% more expensive in China than the US

### C3. Price Skimming
- charge a **high price initially** and as people willing to pay reduces, then we **reduce the price** for the next group of people who are not gone via churn
	- consumers wanting to try product with a lower budget can then afford it (within their budget) $\implies$ based off customers willingness to pay for the product
- can be used when we **do segmentation** on price elasticity
	- target people whose **price elasticity is smaller** (i.e. don't buy fewer quantities of the product because the price has increased)

- public image of the product and company needs to good (Image Supportive)
	- good product quality, product leadership and good branding

- Safety/Hedge
	- cut directly from the bottom line which can severely impact revenues and profits
	- can be dangerous but since we are **starting from a high price**, we have more room to do the skimming (i.e. reducing the price later)
	- should not reduce price $\implies$ $1 reduction in price would affect the bottom line / profit significantly, assuming that costs remain the same

- no immediate competition when doing price skimming (because customers will just go for alternatives or competitors)

### C4. Price Penetration
- setting a low initial price to penetrate the market quickly and deeply
	- we are selling on volume
- attract a large no of buyers
- use when when customers are **price sensitive**, or when the experience curve effects operatives and potential competition
- experience curve effects if operative $\implies$ price is steeper so the cost per unit is reduced with more quantity sold

### C5. Methods & Strategies
1. **Cost-oriented strategies**
	- not recommended to do this unless we are in industry with lots of players selling the same product
	- Markup Pricing based on cost
		- add a predetermined % to the product cost ($25\%$ markup to $\$1$ water will cost $\$1.25$)
		- simple and easy to use
		- is equitable for both the buyer and the seller
		- focuses on the cost of the product and **neglects demand** and customer's willingness to pay more for products that they value

	- Markup Pricing based on sales
		- variation of the above
		- considers sales volume and neglects demand

	- Target profit pricing (not recommended)
		- predetermined return on capital used to produce and market a product
		- target return is based on the standard volume
		- $X$ is not known, so we usually use the historical figures
		$$
		P = DVC + \frac{FC}{X} + \frac{rK}{X}
		$$
		- $\frac{FC}{X} \implies$ fixed cost per unit sold
		- $\frac{rK}{X} \implies$ per unit return for investors

2. **Demand-oriented Pricing**
	- methods used to affect consumer perceptions and behaviour
	- Perceived-value Pricing
		- charge customers on their willingness to pay
		- is the soundest approach and consistent with the marketing concept
		- how to increase the perception of the value of the product

	- Odd / Psychological Pricing
		- set prices below even dollar amounts
		- used to connote lower price level by rounding down

	- Loss Leader Pricing
		- sell products at a loss to increase foot traffic and overall profits

	- Optional product pricing
		- charge for add-ons on top of the base price that one pays (i.e. Tune Hotels)
		- those who want can buy it $\implies$ price discrimination
			- pay only up to what they are willing to pay by charging in different tiers
			- upgrade to higher tiers for more value and benefits
		- price of the optional product can fluctuate from day-to-day based on the demand for the product or service

	- Captive product pricing
		- products to be used in conjunction with a main product
			- i.e. ink refill cartridges for a printer, replacement razer blades
		- main product is cheap, but the captive products are expensive

	- Bundled Pricing
		- good way to make people buy things they don't actually want or need

	- Price Discrimination
		- charging different prices for peak and off-peak periods
		- charging different prices based on the place and the customer segment
		- is not in the negative sense, but rather charging different prices based on the willingness to pay
