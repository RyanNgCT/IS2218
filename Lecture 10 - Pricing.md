## A. Introduction
- could be very important in the workplace

- 4Ps $\implies$ product, place, promotion, price
	- the rest other than price, we have to pay for
	- Price is the only $P$ concerned with how much we get from a customer directly

- How much is the buyer willing to pay for?
	- if we charge every customer the same amount, then we are not exploiting the customer enough
	- we need to charge each and every customer based on their willingness to pay (the maximum amount that they want to pay)

> **Pricing** is the sum of the values that customers exchange for benefits of having using a product
- Importance: is the most tactical of the $4P$s and is the only $P$ revenue

- tactic vs win strategy
	- tactic is **short term in nature** while strategy is a longer-term plan

- if we want to create a new product
	- promotions are at fixed times in the year (specific timings like holidays)
	- availability of a product is very important

- the remaining of the $3P$s will take time to nurture, unlike price which is instantaneous

- importance on pricing w.r.t. inflation and recession
	- how consumers cut spending

- all the other $P$s incur costs
	- product: R&D
	- place: rental or ownership of tangible asset
	- promotion: advertising spendings

## B. Factors Influencing Price
- Economics $\implies$ Supply and Demand. Change at the intersection of both curves
- Accounting $\implies$ based on variable and fixed costs
	- take costs and add a margin to it
- Business / Marketing $\implies$ margin depends on the company's overall strategy
	- dependent on segmentation, targeting, positioning, products, promotions and place strategies
	- **cannot just use the cost** to the business as a benchmark for pricing (cannot equate cost of operations $= \sum$ price for all customers)

- willingness to pay is very hard to find (customers themselves don't even know how much this figure is)

- target audience is different (market segmentation)
	- is pricing fair?

- there are many internal factors based on **marketing objectives, marketing-mix strategy and costs**

- Example: Grab
	- aim for market share  leadership
	- starting out, spend a lot on promotion to customers
	- experience network effects and once it is large enough, customers are reliant on Grab, then no longer need promotions for customer retention
#### Product Quality Leadership
- is one of the pillars for a successful business
- profit margin of shoe reseller is $\approx 99\%$ (margins are very high for resellers)
- where we buy the shoe depends on where we place the shoe in the shop (somewhere deep in the shop vs at eye level when first enter the shop)
#### Price vs Non-price competition
- selling engines vs selling power
- supply the truck vs supply the supply chain solution
- want to make sure that we compete on non-price attributes, and more on delivering something that delivers value (unique selling points)
#### Parallel Importing
- sell a product outside the authorized distribution and selling channels
- i.e. buying a luxury handbag in Europe vs in Singapore
- a.k.a. arbitrage (different prices for the same asset)
#### Costs
- floor price (costs)

- ceiling price (demand), the highest price that we can charge
	- should not be dependent on cost
	- should be a good framework for pricing model

- types of costs involved: fixed, variable, total, average, marginal
	- **marginal cost** is very difficult to find out in every business (how much more cost for one additional customer)
	- viewing cost at an operational level in IS2218
	- can also look at costs in a corporate context (CEO's salary)
		- this salary could be partially fixed and partially variable

	- variable costs in salaries and things like fuel
		- variable cost can include a group of customers

#### Other Price Differentials
- willingness to pay is different at different locations so have different pricing for different locations
- higher rental, different customer demographic

## C. Experience and Experience Curves
- pricing also depends on the volume of products produced
- do things in operations in a more cost-effective way with more experience

- who sets the price?
	- the top manager
