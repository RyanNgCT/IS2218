## Financial Ratios relationship to Shareholder Value
**Components of Shareholder Value**
- Investment Pillar (related to Investment Decisions) $\implies$ this lecture
	- asst turnover and inventory turnover
		- smaller shop vs Haidilao: latter gets more margin for each sale
		- Scoot (low cost carrier) is categorized here
		
	- profits from each sale
		- premium airline is in this category

- Financing Pillar
## Measuring Market Value and Market Value Added
- Idea of **Market Capitalization**: $\# \text{shares } \times \text{Price of each share} - \text{ Total Equity (from balance sheet)}$
	- changes from day-to-day (not book value)
	- also called Market Value of Equity
	- total value of the shares issued

- **Market Value Added**
	- current worth
	- equity comes from from the balance sheet (is a book value)
		- contains all of the initial investments
	- $\textbf{MVA} = \text{market capitalization } - \text{ book value of equity}$ 
	- how much equity has been converted to market value?
	- Possible to have $-ve$ MVA $\implies$ failed to return investors their initial investments
	- cannot conclude solely using MVA that company is doing well $\implies$ have to also look at the Market-to-Book Ratio

- **Market-to-Book Ratio**
	- $\frac{\text{Market Value of Equity}}{\text{Book Value of Equity}}$
	- can be useful to compare companies of different sizes
	- how many times have shareholders original investments been multiplied
	- larger ratio = company is doing a better job

- **Book value of share** (price)
	- $\frac{\text{Book value of Equity}}{\text{No. of shares}}$

We have many different measures to show how a company is doing.

#### Cash Flow
Asset increases, uses up cash.
If current asset increases, then cash should decrease
**Cash Flow Formula = Net Income + Depreciation Expense + Net Changes in working captial** (cash flow from operating)

#### Drawbacks of using Market Value metrics
W hen using the above, there are drawbacks
- share price reflects the **shareholder's or investor's expectation** by holding on to the share (not accurate representation of how the company is doing in future)
- market value may not be a good metric to measure performance of firm's management
- applies only for public companies. cannot observe market value on perform computations for private companies where shares are not traded

## Economic Value Added and Accounting Rates of Return

### Economic Value Added (EVA)
- Look at profit generated. If a loan is taken, interest is charged (what are the interest rate of the funds).
- How much *additional income* is company generating, after the cost of capital
	- Money Generated in Profit (After Tax Operating Income) $-$ (cost of capital $\times$ total capitalization)

- Leverage Companies: companies that take debt (Interest payments become tax exempt)
	- more debt = more leverage

Normally: Net Income for Equity holders + Interest for Debt Holders (applied when not debt funded)
- EVA becomes `Net Income + Debt Holders(1 - tax)`
	- used to compare $2$ companies, fully debt financed vs fully equity financed.
	- if no debt, then is just the Net Income (because no interest as well)
- EVA can also be `EBIT (1 - tax)` $\implies$ net income which the company generates
- have to pay `t` $\times$ Interest to the government
- assume that all companies are $100\%$ equity finance $\implies$ re-calculate net income of the company after this assumption.
- will penalize debt will the tax rate

> **Total Capitalization** = *Long Term Debt + Equity* (not to be mistaken with market cap)
- obtained from the balance sheet (is a book value).
- details what are things that are due
- ignore short-term debt which is paid off
- long term debt is paid $\gt 1$ year

**Total Cost of Capital**
- usually calculated as a weighted average
- look at amount of debt, associated costs with the debt
- take a weighted average accordingly
- Risky Companies: cost of equity is much higher (risk premium for investing in a company)
	- $\downarrow$ risk $= \: \downarrow$ equity cost.

**In Income Statement**
Interest Expense is directly below EBIT
- if company if $100\%$ equity financed, interest is zero $\implies$ entire EBIT is the taxable income

Interest Expense is already included in the income statement which the company has made.
- no adjustment is made for interest
