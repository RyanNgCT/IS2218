- should understand financial statements
- compare financial statements across companies and industries
- reports that summarise activities and financial performance of a business
	- prepared at the end of each accounting period
## Financial Ratios relationship to Shareholder Value
**Components of Shareholder Value**
- determines how good of a job that a particular company is doing
- **Investment Pillar** (related to Investment Decisions) $\implies$ this lecture
	- asset turnover and inventory turnover
		- smaller shop vs Haidilao: latter gets *more margin* for each sale
		- Scoot (low cost carrier) is categorized here
		- profit per sale is much less
		
	- profits from each sale
		- premium airline is in this category (more margin from each sale)
		- need to ensure this happens if we do not have the sufficient volume

- **Financing Pillar**
	- using prudent financial leverage
		- done through debt and interest coverage ratios
	- sufficient liquidity for the coming (fiscal) year?
		- current, quick and cash ratios
## Measuring Market Value and Market Value Added
- Idea of **Market Capitalization**: $\# \text{shares } \times \text{Price of each share}$
	- changes from day-to-day (not book value)
	- also called Market Value of Equity
	- total value of the shares issued

- **Market Value Added**
	- current worth: $\text{Market Cap} - \text{Total Equity (from balance sheet)}$
	- equity comes from from the balance sheet (*is a book value*)
		- contains all of the initial investments
		- greater MVA value $\implies$ more equity has been converted as part of market cap
	- $\textbf{MVA} = \text{market capitalization } - \text{ book value of equity}$ 
	- how much equity has been converted to market value?
	- Possible to have $-\text{ve}$ MVA $\implies$ **failed to return** investors their initial investments
	- cannot conclude *solely* using MVA that company is doing well $\implies$ have to also look at the Market-to-Book Ratio
		- not a fair comparison between smaller and larger sized companies

- **Market-to-Book Ratio**
	- $\frac{\text{Market Value of Equity}}{\text{Book Value of Equity}}$
	- can be useful to compare companies of *different sizes*
	- how many *times* have shareholders original investments been multiplied
		- can tell based on the scale between the current market cap and original investment not on the same scale.
	- larger ratio = company is doing a better job
	- Book value of equity can be found in the Lower RHS of the balance sheet, usually when the company first IPOs

- **Book value of share** (price)
	- $\frac{\text{Book value of Equity}}{\text{No. of shares}}$
	- no. of shares outstanding $\implies$ the no. of share sold and circulating in the market at that point

We have many different measures (or ratios) to show how a company is doing.
- each of the ratio tells one of the small stories that the company has

> **Exercise**
> Market Cap $= 75 \times (14.5 \times 10^6) = 1.0875 \times 10^9 = \$ 1.0875$ billion
> $\text{MVA} = \text{Market Cap} - \text{Equity} = 1.0875 \times 10^9 - (610 \times 10^6) = 0.4775 \times 10^9 = \$0.48$ billion
> Market to Book Ratio $= \frac{1.0875 \times 10^9}{610 \times 10^6} \approx 1.78$
- ðŸ’¡alternative to calculating `market:book` is to calculate book value per share then $\frac{\text{Current Price of each share}}{\text{Book value of share}}$, which yields the same ratio
#### Cash Flow
Asset increases, uses up cash.
If current asset increases, then cash should decrease
**Cash Flow Formula = cash from ops + cash from investments+ cash from investing = Net Income + Depreciation Expense + Net Changes in working capital** (cash flow from operating)
- Interest Expense if **not included** in cash flow formula $\implies$ only in free cash flow
- Increase in Liability = Increase in cash flow (since the bank is providing one with cash)
- Increase in (Current) Asset = Decrease in cash flow (since need to spend more cash to buy or acquire the assets)
#### Drawbacks of using Market Value metrics
When using the above, there are drawbacks
- (current) share price reflects the **shareholder's or investor's expectation** on future profits by holding on to the share (not a 100% accurate representation of how the company is doing in future)
- market value **may not be a good metric** to measure performance of firm's management
	- fluctuations do occur outside of manager's control
- applies only for public companies who are listed on the stock market. Cannot observe market value on perform computations for **private companies** where **shares are not traded**

## Economic Value Added and Accounting Rates of Return

### Economic Value Added (EVA)
- Look at profit generated. If a loan is taken, interest is charged (what are the interest rate of the funds).
- How much *additional income* is company generating, after the cost of capital
	- **EVA** = Money Generated in Profit (**After Tax Operating Income**) $-$ **(cost of capital $\times$ total capitalization)**

- Leverage Companies: companies that take debt
	- more debt = more leverage
	- interest rate can be very cheap for bigger corporations (low repayment rate)
	- Interest payments become tax exempt

Normally: *Net Income for Equity holders + Interest for Debt Holders* (applied only when debt funded)
- Interest expense and debt is the same in this case
- EVA becomes `Net Income + Interest(1 - tax)`
	- used to compare $2$ companies, fully debt financed vs fully equity financed.
	- if no debt, then is just the Net Income (because no interest as well)
- EVA can also be `EBIT (1 - tax)` $\implies$ net income which the company generates
- have to pay `t` $\times$ Interest to the government
- assume that all companies are $100\%$ equity finance $\implies$ re-calculate net income of the company after this assumption.
- will penalize debt will the tax rate

> **Total Capitalization** = *Long Term Debt + Equity* (not to be mistaken with market cap)
- obtained from the balance sheet (is a book value).
- details what are things that are due
- ignore short-term debt which is paid off
- long term debt is paid $\gt 1$ year.
- don't include long-term liabilities.

**Total Cost of Capital**
- usually calculated as a weighted average
- look at amount of debt, associated costs with the debt
- take a weighted average accordingly
- Risky Companies: cost of equity is much higher (risk premium for investing in a company)
	- $\downarrow$ risk $= \: \downarrow$ equity cost.

**In Income Statement**
Interest Expense is directly below EBIT
- if company if $100\%$ equity financed, interest is zero $\implies$ entire EBIT is the taxable income

Interest Expense is already included in the income statement which the company has made.
- no adjustment is made for interest

#### Advantages of EVA
- includes the opportunity cost for investor's money (recognizes that companies need to cover their opportunity cost)
- if one can't generate enough income to compensate shareholders, then investments are worthless
- manager can reduce assets to improve EVA if they aren't helping to increase profits

#### Disadvantages of EVA
- show current performance and not affect by things that move the stock market (static book value)
- balance sheet is a conservative estimate for values
	- brand value etc. are not taken into account in this computation (may have some values not included in ROC)
	- older assets may have fully depreciate

### Accounting Rates of Return (RoR)
- Market Value: how much is the share price
- EVA: how much more we are making when contrasted to the capital
#### Measures of ROR
component from income statement in numerator, component from balance sheet in the denominator
1. Return on Capital (ROC) $= \frac{\text{after tax operating income}}{\text{total capitalization}}$ 
	1. cost of capital (part of capitalization) for each company (will differ for companies)  $\implies$ depends the investor's risk appetite as well.
2. Return on Assets (ROA) $= \frac{\text{after tax operating income}}{\text{total assets}}$
3. Return on Equity (ROE) $\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{equity}}$, net income is before tax.
	1. perspective of an investor (look at net income)
	2. entirely a book

- use the formulas above as they might differ in different textbooks.
## Measuring Efficiency: Turnover Computations
- how the company makes this money
- different business model $\to$ more sales and less profit per sale, less sales but more profit per sale
	- cannot have both because competition will come
	- only one, not both


#### 1. Asset Turnover (Sales)
- Total Asset is total asset value of some arbitrary point in the year.
- tells us how efficient the company is 
- $\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Total assets}}$

#### 2. Inventory Turnover (CoGS)
- Inventory is recorded as a cost and not as a sale
- Formulae: $\frac{\text{CoGS}}{\text{Inventory @ start of the year}}$
- Average days in inventory: If we stop replenishing inventory, how many days can I continue to generate inventory for
- Ideally **less inventory is better** $\to$ idea of just-in-time manufacturing

#### 3. Receivables Turnover (Sales)
- $\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Receivables @ start of the year}}$
- want collection time to be stricter, but not too strict
- average collection period: measures # days to collect payment

#### 4. Payables Turnover (CoGS)
- Formulae: $\frac{\text{CoGS}}{\text{365}}$
- Based on Cost per day, how many days is a company taking to pay its supplier.

#### Answers to Questions
6333 / (9800 / 365) $\approx 236$ days

400 / (73000 / 365) = 2 days worth of inventory
