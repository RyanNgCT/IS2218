## A. Motivation
Slide 2 Answer: They are all American Companies
- What makes this American Companies click?
- Is there a particular **framework** that they use?
- What does one *need to keep in mind* to create a well-known (world-renowned) product

Which countries is famous for coffee
- Colombia, Indonesia, Brazil, Ethiopia, Italy (laid back culture), Vietnam
- *Italy Coffee Shop* is called a bar
- But Starbucks (American) is what you think about when we think about Coffee $\implies$ why is a world-renowned Coffee Chain not from Italy?
	- What is Starbucks *really selling*?
		- ties in to a takeaway culture
		- is different in different places (sells Coffee in the US because of the takeaway culture, while sells *real estate* for students in Singapore) $\implies$ adapts based on different places and countries
		- multiple different aspects that we may not think about when we think about when we hear "Starbucks"
		- cultural adaptation
		- whether we like the coffee at Starbucks or not, it is a very familiar brand

	- street corner coffee or pizza chain general sells better quality products as compared with brands like Starbucks or Pizza Hut

	- expansion to foreign markets may require some re-calibration and adaptation to the local culture of the area
		- the product is not static (can be adapted based on the place where it is sold)
		- also require **cultural adaptation** to the local culture and customs (i.e. McDonalds in India does not have beef burgers, vegetarian counters are separate)
		- vegan and vegetarian options on the menu in certain regions, as compared to fewer examples in Singapore

- Similar concept is applicable in the world of pizza as well

- Donald Trump did not define what was meant by "Make America Great Again"
	- appealing to people's deeper **emotional aspect** instead of having long manifesto campaigns like the rivals (i.e. good to have features of the product, but how it is marketed to consumers also matter)
## B. What is Marketing
> **Marketing** is the activity, set of institutions and processes for creating, communicating, delivering and exchanging offerings that have value customers, clients, partners and society at large
- is communicating value to one's customers (why should the customer care about my product or service?)
- needs: required for people to survive
- wants: needs *shaped by society, culture and personality*
	- $2$ people may need food, but can have different options
	- wants not backed by purchasing power (money)  are just wants / a dream$\implies$ see below

- demands: wants backed by buying / purchasing power

- marketing: **delivering value to customers** and then **capturing value** from customers
	- value captured $=$ price tag to the customer

- ==**Marketing Myopia**: **focusing on the current wants** instead of the underlying needs==
##### Case Study of Marketing Myopia: Kodak
- Film camera manufacturer
	- film rolls have limited capacity ($24$ to $36$ photos only)
	- film rolls could not be reused and have to be *developed into the end product*

- Kodak excelled at film camera, but **failed** in implementing Digital Cameras
- Digital Cameras are much better than film ones and the latter eventually has become obsolete
	- huge leap in technology
	- can choose which photos we want to save and delete, use of SD cards

- Kodak had Marketing Myopia, which caused its downfall
	- people currently want camera films for the need to capture memories, but this doesn't mean that they need camera films (print it)
	- underlying need: to save memories via the camera
	- should have pivoted to digital cameras
### Evolution of Marketing
1. Industrial Revolution: *production is done at scale*

2. Early $20^{th}$ century: Product & Finance
	- product development, performance, features and large industrial empires
	- profits through superior product performance

3. 1930s: Sales
	- sales is just a part of marketing
	- move from scarcity of products to scarcity of markets

4. 1960s: Marketing
	- shift from organization focus to customer focus
	- profit through offerings to match the needs and wants of customers through the 4Ps

5. Early 21st Century: *Digital and Social Platforms*
	- build and strengthen partner & customer relationships (not just through transactions)
	- profits earned through creating platforms for managing offering through sharing, collaboration & outsourcing
### Production Concept
- focus on **production and distribution efficiency** (have a sleek and interconnected supply chain)
- produce products that are inexpensive (highly affordable), and available to the market
	- assume consumers like these kinds of products

- is appropriate when $\text{Supply} \lt \text{Demand}$ and costs are high and improved productivity of workers will lower these costs

- impersonal, insensitive and assembly-line oriented
### Product Concept
- focus on continued product innovations
	- assume customer prefers higher quality, best features and performance products to those that are older (specialization in one key area)
	- may lead to Marketing Myopia (overly narrow definition of business)

- i.e. Apple, creating the "best product in the market"
### Selling Concept
- concentration on selling and promotion of products and services
	- assumes that customers will not buy enough of the product unless stimulated aggressively by the seller
	- normally used for unsought goods (make customer buy things that they don't necessarily need)
	- using hard sell, having an unscrupulous image

- Example: Life Insurance
	- don't see the benefit immediately, but we need to show them the benefits of buying the product (to the next of kin)
### Marketing Concept
- determine the **needs and wants of target markets** and *delivering them more effectively* and efficiently than competitors
- to create, build and maintain beneficial exchanges with potential buyers to achieve organizational objectives
- focus on the buyers needs and characteristics
	- pain points of users and how product helps to alleviate or solve these pain points
	- create messaging to show that the seller understands the customer

- stress regular consumer research and analysis (behavioural wise)
- resources are allocated to make goods and services to be more desired by consumers
### Customer Driven vs Customer Driving
- Driven: understand the needs of customers and deliver their needs
- Driving: We know the needs of customers more than they know themselves

#### Customer Relationship Management
- building and managing profitable customer relationships
- marketing not from today's perspective, but the lifetime revenue of the customers
- can be subdivided into a few groups
	- need to think about the Barnacles (low profitability, but long-term customers) $\implies$ lots of resources required to keep these customers
		- we can fire barnacles

#### Marketing Process
- works on paper, but may not work in practice
- Market Research: two kinds
	- Qualitative: focus groups (as for feedback), individually interview
	- Quantitative: A/B Testing (choose which one is better)
#### Market Segmentation
- breaking the market down into different parts
- can be done mathematically
- SQ vs Scoot
	- corporate clients who need the service vs families

- Use differentiation and positioning
	- change where the company is positioned in the market to accommodate more to their loyal customers
		- Ryanair in Europe can have harder landings
	- positioning is in the mind of the customers

#### 4Ps of Marketing
- Price, Product, Place, Promotion
	- any business that does well can be broken down into the above $4$ attributes

- making the scam so painful obvious that only the most people would fall for it
	- 1% may still reply to scam emails

- In the physical world, we should not make a product just for one person
##### Bottom of the Pyramid $\to$ poor people at the bottom
- people don't have the cash flow to buy a large bottle of soap
- why sell shampoo in packets?
	- LDCs has a huge potential for growth
	- can make the company resilient 
	- helps in innovation

- what parameters or attributes do we need to have in mind when we purchase something
	- enables marketers to create positioning in the mind of consumers

#### Delivering Customer Value
Need to be the best in one of the three parameters and have to be the industry average in the remaining two.
1. Operational Excellence (i.e. IKEA, Decathlon where products are priced competitvely)
2. Product Leadership (i.e. Apple, BMW)
3. Customer Intimacy (i.e. segments and target markets precisely)
	1. different customers have different incentives to buy things (must be good to maintaining good relationship with customers)

#### Product Centric Business Model
Example: Dyson
- performance indicators include market share and # new products
- growth engines: new products and new markets
	- earphones
	- taking the same vacuum cleaner and creating a new market for it

**Disadvantages**
1. Product Life Cycles have reduced
2. Competition has increased because of Globalization
3. Need to move from selling products to solutions instead

#### Segmentation and Lifetime Value
- should only spend a lower value than the lifetime value
