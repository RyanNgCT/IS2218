## A. Motivation
- Slide 2 Answer: They are all American Companies
	- What makes this American Companies click?
	- Is there a particular framework that they use?
	- What does one need to keep in mind to create a well-known (world-renowned) product

- Which countries is famous for coffee
	- Colombia, Indonesia, Brazil, Ethiopia, Italy (laid back culture), Vietnam
	- *Italy Coffee Shop* is called a bar
	- But Starbucks (American) is what you think about when we think about Coffee $\implies$ why is a world-renowned Coffee Chain not from Italy?
		- What is Starbucks really selling?
			- ties in to a takeaway culture
			- is different in different places (sells Coffee in the US, while sells real estate in Singapore) $\implies$ adapts based on different places and countries
			- multiple different aspects that we may not think about when we think about when we hear "Starbucks"
			- cultural adaptation
			- whether we like the coffee at Starbucks or not, it is a very familiar brand

	- the product is not static (can be adapted)

- Similar concept is applicable in the world of pizza as well

- Donald Trump did not define what was meant by "Make America Great Again"
	- appealing to people's emotional aspect
## B. What is Marketing
> **Marketing** is the activity, set of institutions and processes for creating, communicating, delivering and exchanging offerings that have value customers, clients, partners and society at large

- needs: required to survive
- wants: needs shaped by society, culture and personality
	- $2$ people may need food, but can have different options
- demands: wants backed by buying / purchasing power
- marketing: delivering value to customers and then capturing value from customers
	- value captured $=$ price tag to the customer

- Marketing Myopia: focusing on the wants instead of the underlying needs of people
#### Case Study: Kodak
- Film camera manufacturer
	- films could not be reused and have to be developed into the end product
- Kodak excelled at film camera, but failed in implementing Digital Cameras
- Digital Cameras are much better than film ones and the latter eventually has become obsolete

- Kodak has Marketing Myopia
	- people currently want camera films for the need to capture memories, but this doesn't mean that they need camera films (print it)
	- should have pivoted to digital cameras

#### Evolution of Marketing
1. Industrial Revolution: production is done at scale
2. Early $20^{th}$ century: product & Finance
3. 1930s: Sales
	1. sales is just a part of marketing

4. 1990s: Marketing

#### Production Concept

#### Selling Concept
- Example: Life Insurance
	- don't see the benefit immediately, but we need to show that what is the benefit
#### Customer Driven vs Customer Driving
- Driven: understand the needs of customers and deliver their needs
- Driving: We know the needs of customers more than they know themselves

#### Customer Relationship Management
- building and managing profitable customer relationships
- marketing not from today's perspective, but the lifetime revenue of the customers
- can be subdivided into a few groups
	- need to think about the Barnacles (low profitability, but long-term customers) $\implies$ lots of resources required to keep these customers
		- we can fire barnacles

#### Marketing Process
- works on paper, but may not work in practice
- Market Research: two kinds
	- Qualitative: focus groups (as for feedback), individually interview
	- Quantitative: A/B Testing (choose which one is better)
#### Market Segmentation
- breaking the market down into different parts
- can be done mathematically
- SQ vs Scoot
	- corporate clients who need the service vs families

- Use differentiation and positioning
	- change where the company is positioned in the market to accommodate more to their loyal customers
		- Ryanair in Europe can have harder landings
	- positioning is in the mind of the customers

#### 4Ps of Marketing
- Price, Product, Place, Promotion
	- any business that does well can be broken down into the above $4$ attributes

- making the scam so painful obvious that only the most people would fall for it
	- 1% may still reply to scam emails

- In the physical world, we should not make a product just for one person
##### Bottom of the Pyramid $\to$ poor people at the bottom
- people don't have the cash flow to buy a large bottle of soap
- why sell shampoo in packets?
	- LDCs has a huge potential for growth
	- can make the company resilient 
	- helps in innovation

- what parameters or attributes do we need to have in mind when we purchase something
	- enables marketers to create positioning in the mind of consumers

#### Delivering Customer Value
Need to be the best in one of the three parameters and have to be the industry average in the remaining two.
1. Operational Excellence (i.e. IKEA, Decathlon where products are priced competitvely)
2. Product Leadership (i.e. Apple, BMW)
3. Customer Intimacy (i.e. segments and target markets precisely)
	1. different customers have different incentives to buy things (must be good to maintaining good relationship with customers)

#### Product Centric Business Model
Example: Dyson
- performance indicators include market share and # new products
- growth engines: new products and new markets
	- earphones
	- taking the same vacuum cleaner and creating a new market for it

**Disadvantages**
1. Product Life Cycles have reduced
2. Competition has increased because of Globalization
3. Need to move from selling products to solutions instead

#### Segmentation and Lifetime Value
- should only spend a lower value than the lifetime value
