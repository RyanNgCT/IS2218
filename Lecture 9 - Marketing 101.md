## A. Motivation
Slide 2 Answer: They are all American Companies
- What makes this American Companies click?
- Is there a particular **framework** that they use?
- What does one *need to keep in mind* to create a well-known (world-renowned) product

Which countries is famous for coffee
- Colombia, Indonesia, Brazil, Ethiopia, Italy (laid back culture), Vietnam
- *Italy Coffee Shop* is called a bar
- But Starbucks (American) is what you think about when we think about Coffee $\implies$ why is a world-renowned Coffee Chain not from Italy?
	- What is Starbucks *really selling*?
		- ties in to a takeaway culture
		- is different in different places (sells Coffee in the US because of the takeaway culture, while sells *real estate* for students in Singapore) $\implies$ adapts based on different places and countries
		- multiple different aspects that we may not think about when we think about when we hear "Starbucks"
		- cultural adaptation
		- whether we like the coffee at Starbucks or not, it is a very familiar brand

	- street corner coffee or pizza chain general sells better quality products as compared with brands like Starbucks or Pizza Hut

	- expansion to foreign markets may require some re-calibration and adaptation to the local culture of the area
		- the product is not static (can be adapted based on the place where it is sold)
		- also require **cultural adaptation** to the local culture and customs (i.e. McDonalds in India does not have beef burgers, vegetarian counters are separate)
		- vegan and vegetarian options on the menu in certain regions, as compared to fewer examples in Singapore

- Similar concept is applicable in the world of pizza as well

- Donald Trump did not define what was meant by "Make America Great Again"
	- appealing to people's deeper **emotional aspect** instead of having long manifesto campaigns like the rivals (i.e. good to have features of the product, but how it is marketed to consumers also matter)
## B. What is Marketing
> **Marketing** is the activity, set of institutions and processes for creating, communicating, delivering and exchanging offerings that have value customers, clients, partners and society at large
- is communicating value to one's customers (why should the customer care about my product or service?)
	- is broad-based $\implies$ from product branding to the tone of the voice to the social media content
- needs: required for people to survive
- wants: needs *shaped by society, culture and personality*
	- $2$ people may need food, but can have different options
	- wants not backed by purchasing power (money)  are just wants / a dream$\implies$ see below

- demands: wants backed by buying / purchasing power

- marketing: **delivering value to customers** and then **capturing value** from customers
	- value captured $=$ price tag to the customer

- ==**Marketing Myopia**: **focusing on the current wants** instead of the underlying needs==
##### Case Study of Marketing Myopia: Kodak
- Film camera manufacturer
	- film rolls have limited capacity ($24$ to $36$ photos only)
	- film rolls could not be reused and have to be *developed into the end product*

- Kodak excelled at film camera, but **failed** in implementing Digital Cameras
- Digital Cameras are much better than film ones and the latter eventually has become obsolete
	- huge leap in technology
	- can choose which photos we want to save and delete, use of SD cards

- Kodak had Marketing Myopia, which caused its downfall
	- people currently want camera films for the need to capture memories, but this doesn't mean that they need camera films (print it)
	- underlying need: to save memories via the camera
	- should have pivoted to digital cameras
### Evolution of Marketing
1. Industrial Revolution: *production is done at scale*

2. Early $20^{th}$ century: Product & Finance
	- product development, performance, features and large industrial empires
	- profits through superior product performance

3. 1930s: Sales
	- sales is just a part of marketing
	- move from scarcity of products to scarcity of markets

4. 1960s: Marketing
	- shift from organization focus to customer focus
	- profit through offerings to match the needs and wants of customers through the 4Ps

5. Early 21st Century: *Digital and Social Platforms*
	- build and strengthen partner & customer relationships (not just through transactions)
	- profits earned through creating platforms for managing offering through sharing, collaboration & outsourcing
### Production Concept
- focus on **production and distribution efficiency** (have a sleek and interconnected supply chain)
	- essentially the idea of **mass production** (i.e. has the properties of impersonal, insensitive and assembly-line oriented)

- produce products that are inexpensive (highly affordable), and also available to the market $\implies$ keep costs low while scaling production
	- assumes consumers like these kinds of products (easily available and affordable)

- usually the main concept implemented in franchise chains like McDonalds, Starbucks etc.

- is appropriate when $\text{Supply} \lt \text{Demand}$ and costs are high and improved productivity of workers will lower these costs

- usually environmentally destructive and may involve exploiting workers
### Product Concept
- focus on continued **product innovations**
	- assume customer prefers higher **quality**, best **features** and **performance** products to those that may be of less quality and features (specialization in some key areas)
	- may lead to Marketing Myopia (overly narrow definition of business)
		- overemphasis of product features (need to check if features align with customer needs)
		- may miss bigger industry changes and have tunnel vision (could have created another product instead to address needs instead of adding features to an existing product)
	- creates exclusivity of the products sold

- i.e. Apple, creating the "best product in the market" with "exceptional user experience"
	- designed to be user-friendly, intuitive and easy to set up and update
	- Apple sets premium price, but dedicated fan base is willing to pay for superior quality (not just considering the cost aspect as per Production Concept)

- i.e. Brands renowned for quality like Tag Heuer and Doc Martens (could also tie in the Production Concept where they maybe mass produced)
### Selling Concept
- concentration on selling and **promotion of products and services**
	- assumes that customers will not buy enough of the product unless stimulated aggressively / actively persuaded by the seller
	- normally used for unsought goods, such as insurance (make customer buy things that they don't necessarily need)
	- using hard sell, having an unscrupulous image (pervasive and continuous advertising as part of the marketing strategy)
		- prioritizes the quantity of sales rather than the quality
		- employing manipulative tactics. making extravagant promises

- aims to achieve **what the company needs or wants**
	- KPI on sales, more revenue

- Example: Life Insurance
	- don't see the benefit immediately, but we need to show them the benefits of buying the product (to the next of kin)

- Example 2: Email Marketing to advertise sales or cold calling on a large scale
### Marketing Concept
- determine the **needs and wants of target markets** and *delivering them more effectively* and efficiently than competitors (focus is on the **customer**)
- to create, build and maintain beneficial exchanges with potential buyers to achieve organizational objectives
- get to know their customer's likes and dislikes
- focus on the customer's needs and characteristics to build a more *sustainable business*
	- *pain points* of users and how product helps to alleviate or solve these pain points
	- create messaging to show that the seller understands the customer
		- interact with customer through social media presence, to prioritize feature requests by customer base (i.e. Nothing Inc.)

- usually undertaken by *smaller businesses* who don't have the ability to compete on scale (i.e. production concept), but can be applied to larger more established brands as well
	- deeper and better understanding of the customer and fill in the market gaps to meet a niche demand

- stress regular consumer research and analysis (behavioural wise)
- resources are allocated to make goods and services to be more desired by consumers

- **important** because it focuses on *meeting the needs and wants of consumers* $\implies$ align business strategies with customer demand
#### Customer Driven vs Customer Driving
- **Driven:** understand what customers want deeply $\implies$ create products to meet their **current** needs
- **Driving:** understand the needs of customers better than customers themselves $\implies$ create products to meet **current and future** needs
	- more like the philosophy of Apple
	- don't really need to know what the customers themselves want
#### Customer Relationship Management
- process of building and maintaining **profitable** customer relationships by delivering **superior customer value and satisfaction**
- marketing not from today's perspective, but the lifetime revenue of the customers that is collected for the company
- can be subdivided into a few groups
	- need to think about the Barnacles (low profitability, but long-term customers) $\implies$ lots of resources required to keep these customers
		- we can fire barnacles

- need to understand and nurture the true friends as well $\implies$ Customer Relationship and Marketing Process

## D. The Marketing Process
#### Marketing Process
- works on paper, but may not work in practice
- Market Research: two kinds
	- Qualitative: focus groups (as for feedback), individually interview
	- Quantitative: A/B Testing (choose which one is better)
![marketing-process](../assets/marketing-process.png)
#### Market Segmentation
- breaking the market down into smaller parts or groups, organizing them by their distinct needs, characteristics and behaviours
- require separate products and respond to a similar way to a given set of marketing efforts
- can be done mathematically
- i.e. making the Nigerian scam so painful obvious that only the most people would fall for it
	- 1% may still reply to scam emails (targeted victim base)
#### Targeting
- choosing and evaluating which segment to select based on the attractiveness of the segment
- can be $\geq 1$ segment
- SQ vs Scoot
	- corporate clients who need the service vs families
#### Differentiation & Positioning
Use differentiation and positioning to enhance standing amongst competitors
- **Differentiation:** change where the company is positioned in the market to accommodate more to their loyal customers (creating and offering something of superior customer value as compared to competitor products)
	- Ryanair in Europe can have harder landings

- **Positioning:** is in the mind of the customers
	- arranging a product to occupy a clear, distinct and desirable place relative to competing products in the minds of customers
	- most people don't have the mental capacity to deal with 15 to 20 different characteristics or factors of a product (creating a positioning of the product as a whole in the minds of consumers)
	- is perception based, so we need to look from the POV of the customer $\implies$ **not just the seller** viewpoint
		- seller POV: product is fast and cheap, product has the potential to dominate the market
		- customer POV: positioning is not credible and lost (relook at product pricing)
## E. Marketing Management Process
#### 1. Analyse and identify Market Opportunities
1. research and information systems
2. marketing environmental scanning
3. consumer and business markets
#### 2. Research and Select Target Markets
1. measuring and forecasting the demand
2. market segmentation, targeting and positioning
#### 3. The 4`P`s of Marketing $\to$ Developing Marketing Mix
- **Price, Product, Place, Promotion**
	- any business that does well can be broken down into the above $4$ attributes
	- the product itself depends on the price that we charge (i.e. for scoot, we don't have premium things like food, blankets etc.)
	- **Product:** variety, quality, design and features, branding and packaging, services
	- **Price:** List Price, Discounts, Allowances, Payment Periods and Credit Terms
	- **Place:** Channels, coverage, locations, inventory, transportation and logistics
	- **Promotion:** Advertising, Personal selling, Sales promotions, Public Relations
#### 4. Managing the Marketing Effort
- SWOT analysis
- Planning (i.e. setting objectives and company's marketing strategy)
- Implementation (i.e. process of turning strategies into actual actions)
- Control (Evaluating Results and taking corrective actions)
## F. Segmentation
#### Segmentation Example 1: Long Tail Effect
- diversification of products and services
- changing business models to align to consumers
- personalization and customization to niche content and products
- innovation and entrepreneurship
- changes in marketing and distribution (online shop to reach niche audiences)
#### Segmentation Example 2: Bottom of the Pyramid $\to$ poor people at the bottom
- people don't have the cash flow to buy a large bottle of soap at one time
- why sell shampoo in packets?
	- companies in LDCs has a huge potential for growth (by tackling the problems that are present there)
		- are in the early stages of economic development and so the growth of industries in them *can be very rapid*
	- can make the company resilient 
	- helps in innovation (allows for commercial and technological experimentation as well)
		- competitive necessity of maintaining low cost structure pushes companies to discover creative ways to configure products and supply chains to enhance productivity in these markets

	- addresses the need for the (niche) market
		- In the physical world, we should not make a product just for one person
		- Platforms can solve that

- what parameters or attributes do we need to have in mind when we purchase something
## G. Summary
**Marketing Involves:**
1. Understanding your customer's needs (trends)
2. Know your company and its strengths and weaknesses
3. Analyse the competition and the environment
	1. Determine the opportunities and threats to company survival

---
## H. Customer Lifetime Value
### H1. Delivering Customer Value
Need to be the best in **one of the three parameters** and have to be the **industry average** in the **remaining two.**
1. **Operational Excellence** (i.e. IKEA, Decathlon where products are *priced competitively* and are affordable)
	1. providing customers with reliable products and services
	2. can buy products without much difficulty

2. **Product Leadership** (i.e. Apple, Louis Vuitton, BMW)
	1. offering leading-edge solutions and services that enhance customer's usage of a product, to make rival's goods obsolete

3. **Customer Intimacy** (i.e. segments and target markets precisely and matches the demands of those niches wanted by customers)
	1. different customers have different incentives to buy things (must be good to maintaining good relationship with customers) $\implies$ idea of market segmentation and customer relationship management
	2. Apple is not a customer intimate company $\implies$ does not provide **tailored offerings**

⚠️ **Note:** *Operational Excellence + Product Leadership = Product Specific Business Models* (i.e. Part H2)
### H2. Product-centric Business Model
**Properties**
- have a great product and producing at scale with same quality (combines operational excellence, production in bulk with good quality)
- KPIs would include market share, # of new products

**Example: Dyson** (specializes in fluid mechanics)
- *growth engines* for the company: new products and new markets
	- vacuum cleaner company creating headphones (new products for the existing market)
	- taking the same vacuum cleaner and creating a new market for it

**Disadvantages**
1. Product Life Cycles have reduced
2. Competition has increased because of the Internet & effect of Globalization
3. Need to move from *selling products* to **solutions** instead
	1. i.e. warehouse storage space, XYZ-as-a-service
	2. cannot just rent vehicles to compete with other providers with less overhead

### H3. Customer-centric Business Models
- identify the most valuable customers
	- maximise their *long term value* (don't need to necessarily maximise the current purchase margin)
		- is a very important thing amongst salespeople (need to convert a sale) $\implies$ traditional sense whereby we are looking at discrete short term sales rather than the bigger picture
	- **build relationships long-term**, for the future

- key idea: we have a customer, what can we do for this customer?
- all the platform companies look at lifetime value
	- important to consider retention metrics (contributes to the source of revenue)

**Key Facets**
- *Customer Acquisition:* who are my ideal customers and how much are they willing to spend?
- *Customer Retention:* do we make attempts to lock the customer in our ecosystem? to what extent?
- *Customer Development:* developing the best customers
## J. Customer Lifetime Value
> **Customer Lifetime Value** is the dollar value of a customer relationship, i.e. the *net present value* of *all future cash flows* from a customer relationship
- computed using the **past data about a customer** to predict the future 
- $PV$ of all future cash flows
- is useful to inform companies' decision on how much to spent on customer acquisition and retention (helps to justify gain from customer dollars to justify spendings)
	- measures how much customers will generate during their relationship with a given company

- should only spend a lower value as compared with the customer lifetime value (CLV) to recruit  the customer

- can get the retention rate based on those who cancel their subscription or stop visiting the store $\implies$ concept of churn

**Example: Suppose, the monthly cost of a subscription service is `$10`. Historically, a new customer is expected to stay with the service for one year. The variable costs for each customer is negligible. What’s the expected CLV for a new customer?**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Margin / Profit for the company} &= 10 - 0 = 10 \\
\text{Expected CLV} &= \$ 10 \times 12 \text{ months} \\
&= \$120
\end{aligned}
$$
#### Formulae:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&1. \: \text{Present Value of Future Cash Flows} = \frac{\text{Cash Flows}}{(1 + i)^t}, \qquad\text{where i is disc rate}\\\\
2. \: \text{CLV} &= (M - R) \times \left(1 + \left(\frac{r}{1 + d}\right)^1 + \left(\frac{r}{1 + d}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{r}{1 + d}\right)^3 + \ldots\right) \\
&= (M - R) \times \left(\frac{1 + d}{1 + d - r}\right) \\\\
&3. \: \text{Survival Rate for given period t} = r^{t-1}
\end{aligned}
$$
#### Other Properties (Extensions)
- **survival rate:** the percentage of customers who remain despite customer attrition. Only $100r$ customers remain after one year (assuming $t = 1$) $\implies$ need to account for this if we have only a fraction of customers remaining.
- **duration:** are we looking at infinity or only a few periods?
	- dependent on *discount rate* and *retention rate* as well
	- low retention rate, high discount rate $\implies$ large proportion of CLV achieved in the **first few periods** (low retention so large amount is needed to keep almost instantaneously)
	- high retention rate, low discount rate $\implies$ proportion of CLV is **much more spread out**, not cluster solely within first few periods

- when the ==revenue is obtained **after service delivery**==, we use this formula instead:
	- have to discount the first period's revenue as well (no need to add the leading $1$)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{CLV} &= (M - R) \times \left(\left(\frac{r}{1 + d}\right)^1 + \left(\frac{r}{1 + d}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{r}{1 + d}\right)^3 + \ldots\right) \\
&= (M - R) \times \left(\frac{r}{1 + d - r}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
- retention rates will increase over time $\implies \: \therefore$ important to calculate CLV amongst customers of the same cohort
	- especially so for platform business models
#### Example: CLV for Customer Acquisition
**An airline company is looking to acquire new customers. The retention rate historically has been 70%. An average customer spends about $450 twice a year. The variable costs are about $220. What’s the maximum customer acquisition cost that the airline can afford? You may assume a discount rate of 5% per year.**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{CLV}_{\text{Max.}} \text{ or Total Lifetime Value} &= 2 \times (450 - 220) \times \left(\frac{1 + 0.05}{1 + 0.05 - 0.7}\right) \\
&= 1380
\end{aligned}
$$
#### Example 2: CLV for for Customer Acquisition
**Suppose additionally, the airline observes two groups of customers. For group A, the retention rates are 45% and the average spending is about $120. The variable costs are at $50. For group B, the retention rates are 90%, with the average spending at $600. The variable costs are at $290.**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{CLV}_{\text{Max. A}} &= (120-50) \times \left(\frac{1 + 0.05}{1 + 0.05 - 0.45}\right) \\
&= 122.50 \\\\
\text{CLV}_{\text{Max. B}} &= (600 - 290) \times \left(\frac{1 + 0.05}{ 1+ 0.05 - 0.9}\right) \\
&= 2170
\end{aligned}
$$

- above example shows the effects of how segmentation and lifetime value come hand in hand
	- each CLV for each individual segment is different, should not spend more than the CLV value to acquire each customer

### CLV and making Managerial Decisions
- can use CLV to target a specific market segment, as we have seen in example 2 above.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{CLV (Segment)} &= \text{CLV (Avg Customer)} \times \# \text{ customers in that market segment}
\end{aligned}
$$
- can determine the marketing expenditures per customer
	- fire customers with negative CLV

- **Customer Acquisition:** spending $\lt$ CLV (per customer) 
- **Customer Retention:** spending $\lt$ difference in CLV (lump sum spent should not be greater than difference in CLV **before retention and after** the retention)
	- design loyalty campaigns and product promotions

- **Margin Expansion:** cross selling, up-selling, cost cutting resulting in high enough CLV value to cover investments
