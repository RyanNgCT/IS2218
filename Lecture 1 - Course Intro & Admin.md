## B. Corporate Governance & the Agency Problem
**Topic Coverage for this week** 
- Investment and Financial Decisions
- What is a Corporation; what are the goals of a corporation?
- Who is the Financial Manager?
- Agency Problems, Executive Compensation & Corporate Governance
- The Ethics of Maximizing Value
### 1. Investment and Financial Decisions
We make two kinds of decision in our lives -- financial and investment decisions
**Example**: the decision to spend four years in university to pursue a Bachelor's degree
- need some financials to fund this decision (loans etc.)
	- has parallels to the bread-and-butter of companies: have to finance their investment(s)
- cost of university education -- opportunity costs of the revenue or income through employment and also time spent

Companies have to deal with two kinds of problems -- investment decisions and financing decisions.
#### Investment Decision (a.k.a. CapEx or Capital Expenditure)
- we can **obtain either tangible or intangible assets**
	- we can touch and feel tangible (physical) assets versus cannot really feel intangible ones (i.e. R&D of products, know-how or patent)
	- e.g. investing in a plane, Moderna investing in mRNA research, decision to build a pipeline etc.

- also referred to as CAPEX decision or capital budgeting decision
- decision is made to invest in somewhere in order to gain the **highest conceivable returns**
#### Financing Decisions
- the decision on the **sources** and the **amount** of funding (w.r.t. some other investment)
	- i.e. airliner's way to raise funds to buy a plane

- Raising funds to support this decision (through **debt** or **equity**)
	- *debt financing:* we obtain a loan (person who provides money excepts a principal + interest)
		- using **bonds** (promise the person a certain amount of money), which are ***debt instruments*** which are sold in the market (and traded with a $3^{rd}$ party)
			- sort of like an "I owe you"
			- bonds have coupon payments (interest payment + final principal value of the bond)
			- issued by governments and corporations
			- owner of the bond is owed a portion of money

		- **loan** taken from banks, which *cannot be traded on the market*

	- *equity financing:* obtaining a cut on the person's company (i.e. $10\%$)
		- predominantly are through the means of issuing **shares** (also called stock)

	![Financing-Decisions](../assets/Financing-Decisions.png)
#### Both in one example
1. Expanding the Restaurant Business (by opening a new branch) is an investment decision
	- Sourcing for funds to support the business expansion is a financing decision (
		- using a loan through debt financing
			- have to pay the principal + interest at the end of the loan term $\implies$ bank does not take on much risk (business performance does not affect loan repayment, since it has been previously guaranteed already).
	
		- issuance of shares (equity)
			- bring on new investors into the business, but they put themselves at risk if the business does not do well financially.
			- usually there is a guaranteed percentage cut that these investors or shareholders would get.
			
			
2. Pfizer *issuing new shares* to *buy a small biotech company*
	- Issuance of shares (equity) falls under financing decision
	- the decision to buy the biotech company is a investment decision by Pfizer.
### Types of Assets
1. Real Assets
	- are tangible in nature
	- used to produce goods and services

2. Financial Assets
	- claims to the income generated by the firm's real assets
	- examples: securities (i.e. stocks and bonds)
> *def:* A **Security** is any financial assets that can be traded in a public market.
### 2. Corporations
- has a lot of shareholders $\implies$ any loss is **capped** by the **amount the shareholder has invested** into the corporation
- separates the owner from the business from the controller (the CEO), unlike a (sole) proprietorship where the business and the owner are the same $\implies$ separation of ownership and control (a.k.a. **permanence**)
	- the business is organized as a *distinct legal entity* that is owned by shareholders
	- corporation will outlive its human workers (won't close down when the owner dies), the corporation will live on
	
- corporation has double taxation, whereas in a sole proprietor there is only a single tax stream
	- double taxation via income taxation for corporation and the taxes imposed when they give out dividends $\to$ profits received from share of ownership (under capital gains)

- The Board of Directors is **elected by shareholders** to safeguard their interests in the company (similar to elected MPs serving constituencies)
	- main role is to appoint the managers (i.e. C-suite) and monitor their performance (are they meeting the goals, KPIs to help shareholders earn money)
	- if someone buys over 100% of company by offering a rate higher than the current share price, then sometimes the BoD has no choice but to give in and allow the buy-over / acquisition.
#### Types of Corporations
- public: can *trade that stock* in the stock market (i.e. a share of Apple Inc.)
- private: it is *privately held* (i.e. a privately down juice shop)

Limited liability - cannot come after owners if company closes down
### Sole Proprietorship
- often uses bank loans as the financing option / financial decision
	- bank can come after the owner's assets if he owes them money and is proven to be unable to repay the loan amount (i.e. failure to pay back loan may result in the loss of assets)
	- however, as a shareholder of a corporation, one is **not responsible** for the corporation owing money.
### 3. Types of Businesses
1. Sole Proprietorship (see above)
	- self-owned, self-employed
	- business is NOT distinct from the owner
	- Benefits of remaining a Proprietorship
		- sole proprietor does not have to pay corporate tax
		- when dividends issued in corporation, shareholders pay capital gains tax (no such thing when business = owner) $\implies$ not applicable to Singapore but is in force elsewhere

2. Partnership
	- owned and controlled by $\geq 2$ people

3. Corporation
	- separate legal entity

4. Limited Liability Partnerships / Limited Liability Corporations


5. Professional Corporation

### Who is the Financial Manager?
- cash returned to the investors is known as dividend
### What are the goals of a corporation?
- need some metric to measure profit $\implies$ the share price of the company (which represents the profit potential of the company)
	- current market value of shareholder investment
#### 1. Shareholders desire wealth accumulation
- maximise current market value of shareholder investment in the firm

#### 2. Why not profit maximization?
Earning manipulation
- companies cutting costs (i.e. Boeing)
- doing illegal things to manipulate numbers etc. 

Agency Problem: the CEO acts in their own personal interest or other interests instead of the shareholder?
- legal requirement: regulations governing
- activist shareholders (i.e. pension funds, which hold from 5 to 10% of a company)

Stock Option: benefits if the corporation's stock hits a certain price

### Agency Problems, Executive Compensation & Corporate Governance
