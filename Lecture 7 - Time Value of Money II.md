## A. Perpetuities and Annuities
#### Present Value of Annuity
- gives us how much each of the cash flows are worth in today's dollars
	- âš  without the multiplicative factor of $(1+r)^t$
$$
PV_{\text{Annuity}} = C \times \left(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r(1+r)^t}\right)
$$
#### Future Value of Annuity Payment
- we want to find out *how much value* that we want to have at a certain point in time (i.e. at the point of retirement)
	- $PVAF$ is the **annuity factor** in this case
$$
\begin{aligned}
FV_{\text{Annuity}} &= [C \times PVAF] \times (1 + r)^t \\\\
&= C \cdot(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r(1+r)^t}) \times (1 + r)^t \\\\
&= \boxed{C \times \frac{(1 + r)^t -1}{r}}
\end{aligned}
$$
- recall $PV$ is also given by: $C \times PVAF \implies$ total investments, when converted to present value
- we always ==assume that the saving is given **at the end of each year** or period==
- *formula equivalent:* if we make a contribution of $\$C$ every *month or year*, at rate of $r\%$, then we can derive the value of the money at some later time (i.e. retirement) after $t$ periods (months or years, depending on the context as well)

- two ways of going about it:
	- calculating present value of annuity $PV_{\text{Annuity}}$, then calculate future value of annuity $FV_{\text{Annuity}} = PV_{\text{Annuity}} \times (1+r)^t$
	- calculate $FV_{\text{Annuity}}$ directly given the above formula

**Slide 39**
$$
\begin{aligned}
FV_{\text{Annuity}} &= 3,000 \times \left(\frac{1}{0.08} - \frac{1}{0.08(1+0.08)^4}\right) \times (1 + 0.08)^4 \\
&= \boxed{\$ 13,518.34} \quad \text{(to 2 d.p.)}\\
&= 3,000 \times \frac{(1 + 0.08)^4 -1}{0.08}
\end{aligned}
$$
**Slide 41**
$$
PV = 10,000 \times \left(\frac{1}{0.05} - \frac{1}{0.05(1 + 0.05)^{30}}\right) = \boxed{\$ 153,724.51} \quad \text{(to 2 d.p.)}
$$
**Slide 43**
- we are contributing $\approx \$ 430$ per year to the retirement fund and we effectively only put in $430 \times 50 \text{ years} = \$21,500$ in total
- need to invest the money (small amount of value currently), to reap benefits in the future (i.e. large amount of $FV$)
- investment is done at the end of each year for $50$ years
$$
\begin{aligned}
500,000 &= C \times \left(\frac{1}{0.1} - \frac{1}{0.1(1 + 0.1)^{50}}\right)  \times (1 + 0.1)^{50} \quad \textbf{or:}\\
500,000 &= C \times \frac{(1 + 0.1)^{50} -1}{0.1} \\
\therefore C &= \boxed{\$429.59} \quad \text{(to 2 d.p.)}
\end{aligned}
$$
## B. Annuities Due
> **Annuity Due** is a level stream of cash flows *starting immediately*
- the downpayment is the first payment made, usually followed by fixed instalments over a period $t$
	- annuity due is a *subset of a "regular" annuity* where we have an immediate downpayment followed by a series of payments (==payments occur at the **beginning of each period**==)
- suppose the instalment is $1,000 per year.
- however, seller want us to pay in advance (each payment is worth $1 + r$ more as it can be used to **generate interest**)
	- we need to **invest or pay one year or one time period ahead** instead
	- receiving payments earlier with an annuity due $\implies$ allows more time to earn interest with compounding and have *potentially* higher future value (so $PV_{\text{Annuity Due}}$ is generally **more valuable**)
	- so we have:
		- $PV_{\text{Annuity Due}} = PV_{\text{Annuity}} \times (1+r)$ and 
		- $FV_{\text{Annuity Due}} = FV_{\text{Annuity}} \times (1 + r) = PV \times (1 + r)^t \times (1+r)$
$$
\begin{aligned}
FV_{\text{Annuity}} &= \left(429.59 \times \frac{1}{0.1} - \frac{1}{0.1(1+0.1)^{50}}\right) \times (1+ 0.1)^{50} \times (1+ 0.1)\\
&= \$ 550,003.81 \quad \text{(to 2 d.p.)} \gt \$500,000 \quad \text{for normal annuity}
\end{aligned}
$$
- time duration of loan (number of periods) will *dramatically change* if we have a change payment
	- pay less $=$ have to pay for a lot longer.
## C. Home Mortgages & Amortization
- Bank will also do simple annuity calculation by putting a rate of interest on the downpayment (downpayment is because unlikely for bank to make the full payment) $\implies$ which in the case of the example is 1% per time period $t$, which is months
	- for normal annuity, the bank charges interest of $r$% **as part of the annuity payment** $\$C$
		- interest to be paid is a component of this payment $C$

	- reduction of the principal amount of the loan is known as **amortization**

- Bank starts to charge interest and so when we pay off the loan, a portion of payment is use to write off the interest value
## D. Effective Interest Rates
- effective annual interest rate is the interest rate that is annualized using compound interest
- The Interest component keeps decreasing year on year
	- higher % of payment amount goes to reduce the principal amount rather than the interest amount

**Effective Annual Interest Rate**
- how we can convert interest rates to an annual rate
- we take into consideration the effect of compounding.
$$
EAR = (1 + MR)^{12} -1
$$
**Annual Percentage Rate** $\to$ lousy
- the interest rate that is annualized using **simple interest** (and not compound interest)
- is quite frankly useless in calculations, but good for understanding
$$
APR = MR \times 12
$$

- $EAR - APR$ provides us with the additional interest as an effect of compounding
## E. Relevant Spreadsheet Formulae
- each of the values are dependent on the four other values
- the brackets mean that the parameters are optional
	- if `type` not specified (defaults to `0`), means at the end of the year (regular annuity)
	- if `type = 1` $\implies$ start of period (annuity due)

- can use excel to do the assignment
	- need to note the formula with the relevant rows
	- can only used to be done without excel (by trail and error)

- if the sign inverts $\implies$ rate lies between $5$ and $10$%

- most of the formulas return a negative number
## F. Inflation
> **Inflation** is the rate at which prices as a whole are increasing
- inflation is done based on the usual things that people buy (the consumer price index)

> The **Nominal Interest Rate** is the rate at which money invested grows
- *"current"* and *nominal* are interchangeable, does not take into account inflation (i.e. "GDP at current")

> The **Real Interest Rate** is the rate at which the purchasing power of an investment increases
- "GDP at *constant* prices" $\implies$ price is fixed, see if GDP is increasing
$$
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{Accurate Formula:}\\

1 + \text{real interest rate} &= \frac{1 + \text{nominal interest rate}}{1 + \text{inflation rate}} \\\\

\textbf{Approximation Formula:} \\
\text{Real int. rate} &\approx \text{nominal int. rate} - \text{inflation rate}
\end{aligned}
$$
### Current vs Real Cash Flow
- for current dollar cash flows (not considering inflation) $\implies$ **nominal interest rate**
- for real dollar cash flows (considering inflation) $\implies$ **real interest rate**

- today's dollars $\iff$ today's prices

### Question
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{a)} \\
PV &= 30,000 \times \left(\frac{1}{0.1} - \frac{1}{0.1(1+0.1)^{30}}\right) \\
&= 282807.43 \quad \text{ (to 2 d.p.)} \\\\
\text{b)} 
\end{aligned}
$$

Part e) we use the future value
Part f) Real is with inflation, nominal is not considering inflation
