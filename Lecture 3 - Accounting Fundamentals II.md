## A. Profit vs Cash Flow
**Key Question: What is this `Cash Flow`?**
difference between profit and cash
- depreciation
- accrual accounting
#### 1. Depreciation
- *differs by depreciation*
- simply an **accounting mechanism** to split the expense of the acquisition over the period of asset's useful life
	- amount of the cost price that the asset has used for this year

- use profit subtract depreciation (as a non-cash **expense**), since money "leaves" the system
- profits ignore cash expenditures on new capital

- Depreciation is not depleting cash, it is just subtracted from our profits
	- Profits ignore cash expenditure
	- when we buy new equipment, the expense is capitalized (increase equipment account by $X$ value)
	- don't record expenses of $X$ in our income statement immediately

- Depreciation is like a phantom costs, is a non-cost expense (asset value is decrease).

- Depreciation causes an actual decrease on the income statement
	- actual cash is not leaving the system, so it is recorded on the income statement and not the balance sheet.
	- entire upfront cost of asset is **not entirely used** to generate the profit and thus it is not recorded *fully* in the income statement (need another mechanism to record depreciation $\implies$ hence comes the cash flow statement)
		- only a small chunk of it called depreciation
		- also need cash to make purchases

not enough for company to make money strictly according to the income statement

**Profit**
- looking at all the revenues and costs associated with a sale

**Share Price**
- even though profits are low, share prices may be quite high $\implies$ share price is a function of **future earning potential**
#### 2. Accrual Accounting
- "profits" record income and expense at the time of the sale, not at the time when cash exchanges actually occur
	- sale is recorded today, we record the profit **at the point of service rendered**
	- payment might be done $60 - 90$ days later etc.
	- whether we break up this profit amount depends on the time period required for the service as well (i.e. 10 year long term period etc.)

- must match the revenue and the expenses

IS2218 is not looking at this at a transactional level, but rather to understand what *annual reports* means.

**Slide 24**
- At the point of period 2 (when the sale occurs), the agreed-upon amount to collect from the customer is also recorded in income statement of the company
- flow of cash can be positive or negative
```
Income           0                 50              50               0
Cash           -200                0              +150            +150

#### Slide 27/28
a. What is shareholders’ equity in 2018? 
$A = L + E$

b. What is shareholders’ equity in 2019? 

c. What is net working capital in 2018? 
$\text{Current Assets } - \text{Current Liabilities}$

d. What is net working capital in 2019?


e. What are taxes paid in 2019? Assume the firm pays taxes equal to 21% of taxable income.
Fixed Asset increase from 800 $\to$ 900. Income statement is depreciating by $-350$, so $450$ worth of fixed assets was bought in between 2018 and 2019.

f. Net fixed assets increased from $800 million to $900 million during 2019. What must have been South Sea’s gross investment in fixed assets during 2019?

## B. Statement of Cash Flow
- analogy: video that tells us how much cash a company has obtained or lost in a year
- tally all the cash outflow and inflow $\implies$ somewhat made complicated because of accountants
- shows how $C_1 \to C_2$, where $C_i$ is a balance.
	- shows the journey or process

- is not a new statement, can be constructed using a balance sheet and income statement
	- this is required for business who conform to accrual accounting standards
- if we don't receive cash, we can't record it (???)

- Main Principle: Records revenue as it is earned and record expenses as they are incurred

- Net cash flow should match up

- **cannot** just tally up the cash outflows and inflows to obtain the cash balance

**Components**
Only Three uses of cash (inflow or outflow)
- Cash provided by Operations (short-term, involves current assets and liabilities)
	- in my daily operations, how much cash am I receiving and spending?
	- derived from the income statement
	- include working capital items: a preset of $5$ possible items.
		- accounts receivable $\pm$ : collect payment, or someone owes you money
			- account receivable increase, have to put a $-$ sign $\implies$ converse is putting $+$ sign
		- inventory $\pm$ : inventory reduction $\implies$ releases case (put $-$ sign)

	- Liability $\uparrow$, meant to pay but yet to pay $= \uparrow$ cash flow
	- Liability $\downarrow$, paid liao $= \downarrow$ cash flow

- Net Income $\implies$ assume everyone you provided the service for have paid you already

- Cash flows from investments (long-term)
	- purchase or sale of equipment, land and long-term assets

- Cash provided for financing activities
	- receiving loans, pay off loans
	- used direct methods $\implies$ record the inflow and outflow of cash directly (using the Balance Sheet) 
	- Short-term debt is parked under here.

### Summary
- Cash from Ops (changes to current assets / liabilities) 
- Cash from Investments (changes to long-term assets only) 
- Cash from Financing (changes to liabilities and equity)
### Others
Revenue (sales) before expenses, income after expenses.
- both sales and net income is detailed in the income

Bracket means **less the value.**
Net increase (or decrease) should be the difference between cash in the balance sheet across period, but may not be always the case.
Leverage = interest rate is very low for the amount borrowed $\implies$ reduction of tax burden.

### Free Cash Flow
- is available to everyone, including non-shareholders

- how to performance of a company (i.e. hard for startups to break even and obtain an income / profit)
- One with debt versus one of equity
	- debt: pay a lot of interest to the bank
	- equity: no need to pay interest off, but had dividends

Free Cash Flow = Interest (Expense) + Cashflow from Operations + Cashflow from Investments
- Interest Expense $\implies$ one pays for his loans.
- cash available for investment from the corporation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{CO} &= 6382 + 1402 - 40 - 5 + (3403 -3143) \\
&= 4994 \\\\
\text{CI} &= \\\\
\text{CF} &= \\\\
\text{FCF} &= 8079 \times 0.79 + 0 
\end{aligned}
$$
### Taxation
**Case Study 1**
help to offset loss with a future profit
Y1: -100 (not taxed)
Y2: +100 (offset of $-80$% of profit, so only pay $20$%), lost $80 credit
Y3 = +100 (taxable income will be $80$)

interest is not taxable
interest taken on debt-funding is tax-exempt

#### Personal Income Tax
- marginal tax rate: tax that one pays for each additional dollar of income
- average tax rate: $\frac{\text{Total Tax Bill}}{\text{Total Income}}$
